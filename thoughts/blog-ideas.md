## The Elixer Effect
Talk about the `elixer` item from FFIII and how single-use-non-rechargable items
encourage players never to use them.
Talk about BoTW and how high-damage weapons never got used because I was saving
them for a fight that never came.

## Typesafe Return Status
Wrap an `int` in a struct and have a macro `ERROR(x)` that will extract the
that int.
If zero implies success then `if (ERROR(status))` will become an explicit
error check *and* you can reuse the macro for `strerror`-style error number
extraction.
Could also have a macro/function `MAKE_STATUS`/`make_status` that will construct
this struct.

## Cron Job to Automate Being a Good Romatic Partner
Automated email reminders to initiate and set up dates.
Use two lines in my crontab that send me email reminders every X and Y days
where X and Y are relatively prime so that the time at which dates are scheduled
doesn't *just* become painfully predictable monthly or bi-monthly event.

Automated text reminders to ask partner about their day at 18:00 every weekday.

## Elseless Programming
Reference that Golang talk about the things in go that the speaker never uses.

## Golden Testing in C99
Use autil library as example.
Or put together a minimal Makefile + boilerplate code to get started.

## Pre C99 static assert
Use the hackey enum trick.

## Golflibc
ANSI C standards compliant libc that uses the fewest number of possible ASCII
characters.

## Metronome-Lang
Esolang that has random effects for some core keywords, where the initial RNG
seed is based the hash of the program. Allows random-effects to happen while
programming while still being deterministic.
