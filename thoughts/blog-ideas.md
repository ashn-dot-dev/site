## Tree-based Programming Langauge
Programming language with a data model centered around the tree data structure.
Lisp *kind of* does this with s-exprs, but most lisps treat non-atoms as
references, so the data model of lisp is more of a directed graph than a tree.
All values are copied (persistent data structure with CoW semantics), but can
be made references by explicitly opt-in.

## The Elixer Effect
Talk about the `elixer` item from FFIII and how single-use-non-rechargable items
encourage players never to use them.
Talk about BoTW and how high-damage weapons never got used because I was saving
them for a fight that never came.
