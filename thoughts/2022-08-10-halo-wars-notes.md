Halo Wars
=========

Picked this game up for pretty cheap on Steam. I haven't played Halo Wars since
I last owned a PC. I mainly wanted to mess around in skirmish, but I figured it
would also be fun to go through the campaign again. I spent some time getting
the automatic difficulty in skirmish up to the maximum of 100 and then after
that I worked my way through the campaign on heroic.

There's not a whole lot to say about this game, the campaign is short and sweet
and the skirmish mode is good simple fun when playing against bots. This game
is super simple for an RTS, which is great for me because I was never really
into the RTS genre due to its complexity, and this game gives me a dumbed-down
version of the genre in a fictional world that I am familiar with.

Overall I really enjoyed the ~16 hours I spent with Halo Wars. I don't think
its the most amazing game of all time, but the campaign was a lot of fun (with
plenty cheesy dialog), and the skirmishes kept me entertained, so I would say
it was a worthwhile way to spend a couple of nights. My favorite character was
definitely Anders, both because I think she has the best perk set, and because
flying units are waaaaaay overpowered in this game.

I don't know, there is not much more to say.

7/10, good game
