DOOM (2016) Notes
=================

Purchased this game on Steam during a sale, so I think I paid less than $20 for
it. I beat this game once before on normal difficulty a few years ago, way
before I got super into classic Doom. Back when I first played the game I
thought it was pretty good, and I thought it would be fun to re-assess the game
now that I have a much better appreciation for the franchise as a whole. I
decided to play this run on UV.

Overall I thought the game was pretty good. Nice visuals, fun gunplay, and
arenas that were laid out in a way that facilitated constant movement and
action. This definitely *felt* like a Doom game. For about the first 1/3 of the
game I tried to 100% each map, but by the time I got to the tower level I
realized that 100%-ing levels was just not that fun in Doom 2016. Once I
started ignoring bonus challenges and secrets I got a lot more enjoyment out of
the game. For about the last 1/2 of the game the UV difficulty ended up pushing
me towards using the rocket launcher and gauss cannon almost exclusively. No
other weapons were dealing enough damage to efficiently deal with threats, so I
actually think it might be better to play this game on normal difficulty in the
future in order to get more variety in the viable arsenal. Other than that I
don't really have much to say; It's DOOM! Good game that was definitely worth a
playthough.
