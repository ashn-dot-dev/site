Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic Notes
===========================================

Purchased for $15 on Nintendo Switch after seeing it in the eShop. Just finished
a full playthrough on the normal difficulty setting. I chose to build my
character, Ash Nolan, as a `soldier` / `jedi consular` that duel wielded (w/ two
weapon fighting feats) lightsabers and used heavy armor. I primarily used
`Heal`, `Force Wave`, `Adv Throw Lighsaber`, and `Destroy Droid` as my force
powers, but picked up `Dominate Mind` for some speech options, and chose (but
didn't really use) `Stasis` and `Force Suppression`. This was a light-leaning
grey jedi playthrough where I primarily chose the light side path for quests &
speech options, but had zero moral qualms about choosing dark side options when
dealing with assholes and/or evil characters.

This was the first time I have played KOTOR since my time as an undergraduate.
As an undergrad I played this game to death. I did full playthroughs as a grey
jedi character, light side points only character, and dark side points only
character. I think I did challenge runs like no leveling up until you leave
Taris and become a jedi (except for the mandatory lvl 1->2 level up on the Endar
Spire), beat the game solo in hard mode, etc. So I have a lot of history with
this game and I was excited to revisit it after so many years.

This is the first time I've played KOTOR on console. I originally played the
game on PC, and the Switch controls took some getting used to. I imagine that
the Switch version is *probably* based off of the XBox release, and I was
honestly expecting things to be a lot worse then they were. Menuing and combat
action selection is a lot slower and more cumbersome then I remember it being on
PC, but I ended up adjusting to the console controls after after a couple of
hours.

This was also the first time that I've ever done a playthrough where my PC used
armor. Generally I ditch my armor for jedi robes after I choose my jedi class,
but for this playthrough I decided to use heavy armor for the rest of the game.
Using armor ends up restricting a **lot** of force powers, including the `Burst
of Speed` family, which ended up making the run a lot more fun because I
couldn't just rely on the "Master Speed go brrrr" combat strategy. I ended up
settling on the `Heavy Exoskeleton` + upgrades as my endgame heavy armor which,
in combination with my base strength of 16 and the `Dominator Gauntlets`, ended
up giving me a strength stat of 24 (+7 modifier).

My full endgame stats were (just before the final battle with Malak):

My plan for this playthrough was to go through the game with a party consisting
of one other jedi and Mission as much as possible. I have never done a
playthrough where I actually used Mission after Taris, and I wanted to see what
it would be like having her as a main party member throughout the playthrough.
Mission has pretty terrible stats for combat, but I thought if I invested all of
skill points into demolitions, awareness, and security then she could handle all
the mine recovery and lock picking while the other party member and I handled
all the combat. This worked out pretty well, and I ended up keeping mission in
the part for almost the entire playthrough except for the sections of the game
where you party is automatically selected and the Temple of the Ancients / Star
Forge where I specifically wanted an all-jedi party for the mostly
combat-oriented endgame. My playthrough area order and party composition for
this playthrough was (approximately):

+ Endar Spire
    + Ash Nolan
    + Trask Ulgo
+ Taris
    + Ash Nolan
    + Carth Onasi
    + Mission Vao
+ Dantooine
    + Ash Nolan
    + Mission Vao
    + Bastila Shan
        + Replaced with Juhani when Bastila was made unavaliable.
+ Korriban (chosen first to get good gear early)
    + Ash Nolan
    + Mission Vao
    + Juhani
+ Tatooine
    + Ash Nolan
    + Mission Vao
        + Worked though main parts of the side quest with Mission's brother.
    + Bastila Shan
        + Completed side quest with Bastila's mother.
+ Kashyyyk
    + Ash Nolan
    + Mission Vao
    + Zaalbar
        + Replaced with Bastila once Zallbar was taken.
        + Replaced with Jolee once I met him in the Shadowlands.
+ Leviathan
    + Juhani (for solo prison section)
    + Ash Nolan
    + Carth Onasi
    + Bastila Shan
+ Mannan
    + Ash Nolan
    + Mission Vao
        + Breifly switched out with Juhani to finish the side quest with the
          racist Cathar slaver NPC.
    + Jolee Bindo
        + Completed side quest with Sunry.
+ Rakata Prime
    + Ash Nolan
    + Jolee Bindo
    + Juhani
+ Star Forge (saved Bastila and got light side ending)
    + Ash Nolan
    + Jolee Bindo
    + Juhani

This was the first playthrough where I actually played the Pazzak minigame. It
was not very fun and I'm pretty sure there is some AI cheating going on. I tried
to play Pazzak with every person I met at least once, but about half way through
the game I gave up because it was so boring and RNG dependent. I did grind my
way to enough wins against Suvam Tan to get the cheaper prices in his shop.

The Ebon Hawk turret minigame sections are absolutely terrible. They might have
been fun and interesting in 2003, but with horribly stiff controls that were not
optimized well for console, and with the minigame repeating five or six times
during my playthrough with essentially zero changes, I was really growing tired
of this part of the game by the end of my playthrough.

Characters in this game are really well written. Bastila is pretty annoying and
her battle-meditation-plot-convenience feels like a poor way to give her
importance to the plot, but other than that I think the cast of KOTOR is really
fantastic. I forgot how much I enjoyed learning the backstory of all these
characters, and it was really a treat getting to comb through all their dialog
again. Jolee is my favorite character by far, and it was really a treat having
such a multi-dimensional character in a game that tends to reduce choices down
to "are you a saint or a murderhobo".

Along those same lines, the plot of KOTOR is great. I think the game does show
its age a bit, and video game writing has come a long way since 2003, but there
is a quaint charm to it all. The game tends to break down larger objectives into
a number of side quests that each play out in their own arc with a defined
beginning, middle, and end. For example... The goal of the game is to find the
star forge. To find the star forge you must reconstruct a full map to the
station from four maps scattered across the galaxy. One such map is on Korriban,
so you travel to Korriban only to learn that you can't access the map until you
prove your worthiness Sith Academy headmaster. To prove your wordiness you
tackle a number of small sub-missions, one of which involves investigating a
tomb where the previous (now exciled) headmaster of the academy is hiding. While
investigating you are captured and have a small side-quest that ends with you
killing the previous headmaster and saving another captured student (at least
that's how I did the quest in my playthrough). The long-term progression of the
game comes from these missions that are accomplished recursively completing
smaller isolated missions which are themselves completed through combat
challenges, logic puzzles, investigations, conversations, and more! And it all
blends together so well that by the time you reach the end of the game you
really feel like you have been on a *journy*. Some parts are certainly rough
around the edges, but it has been a long time since I've played a game that had
such a lovely story progression. KOTOR is based on a D20 system, and I think
BioWare did a fantastic job of capturing the essence of a full D&D campaign, so
good on them for being a great DM.

However, KOTOR has some serious flaws. The minigames in KOTOR are not fun; I
mentioned before how the Ebon Hawk turret minigame is terrible, and Pazzak was
boring, but I should also mention that the swoop racing minigame was pretty
lackluster as well. Again, in 2003 these might have been a lot more impressive,
but I do not see any of these minigames are core to the experience of KOTOR, and
I can't say that any of the minigames were worth my time.

Another big issue with KOTOR is the game balance. Even though I just praised
KOTOR for how well it plays as a D&D campaign, I think the balance of classes
and skills is absolutely bonkers. Jedi are crazy overpowered; In the endgame my
PC's right-hand lightsaber did 6-30 damage with a +4 attack modifier and +7
blaster bolt deflection, and my left-hand lightsaber did 3-24 damage with +2-12
damage vs dark side enemies, +8 attack modifier, and +3 blaster bolt deflection.
Spamming `Master Power Attack` I was able to do 70+ damage per round if both
sabers connected, and pretty much every enemy I attacked would go down in one or
two rounds. On top of the crazy high damage output, force powers are absolutely
busted with `Heal` and `Force Wave` completely breaking most combat scenarios.
Having 2+ jedi able to use `Heal` at pretty much any time makes your party
practically invincible, and I used almost no health items for the rest of the
game after unlocking `Cure` on Dantooine. Compare that with ranged characters
like Mission and Carth with DPS that is nowhere even close to the PCs, even with
properly outfitted / upgraded weapons and armor. Mission was in my party for
most of the game, but barely ended up contributing to the DPS of the group: I
would have Mission spam whatever variation of `Sniper Shot` she had at the time,
but compared to any jedi character it was just no contest. I understand that
from a lore perspective the jedi characters *should* be much more powerful than
the non-jedi characters, but from a gameplay perspective the balance doesn't
provide enough incentive to use the non-jedi characters unless you are
specifically crafting a run to use non-jedi like I did this time around with
Mission. To this day I have never used T3-M4, HK-47, or Canderous as main party
members during a run outside of one or two areas (and I have literally never
used T3 after Taris *ever*).

Okay so busted game balance issues aside, I enjoyed my time with KOTOR.
According to my switch I spend just shy of 40 hours on this run. In my head this
game was a *lot* shorter, so ~40 hours was a bit of a shock. This was a nice
return to a game from my youth, but I don't think I am going to start another
run anytime soon. I would have liked to do a dark side playthrough as Darth
Murderhobo, but I realistically don't have 30+ hours to sink into another run.
