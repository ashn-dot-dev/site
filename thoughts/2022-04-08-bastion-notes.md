Bastion
=======

Originally played this game on PC way back in university. I never completed it,
but it turns out that in my first playthough I was like 80% of the way through
the game when I put it down. I bought Bastion for switch something like two
years ago and never got around to playing it until yesterday. I started
yesterday evening and finished today by noon, so the game is pretty short. I
had a good time, so I assume it was worth however much money I payed for it
when I bought it on the Nintendo eShop.

The visuals and narration are really well done, and I think that Bastion is on
the upper end of the pretty video game spectrum. The story is short and sweet,
but there was a good amount of worldbuilding, and by the end I was more
invested in the plot then the actual combat mechanics of the game. I chose to
save Zulf and Reset the World as my ending in order to save the most lives, but
I would like to go back and try the other options if I ever do a NG+ run.

Gameplay wise I honestly don't think Bastion is anything special - the combat
has a really low skill threshold and story mode is really *really* easy to
beat. When you start a new game you are given an option between the equivalent
of an easy and normal mode. I chose the normal mode, but never really faced a
difficult challenge in-game. I was pretty much always had the max amount of
healing items at my disposal, and all enemies (even bosses), can be taken out
in a few hits. I mained the War Machete & Army Carbine for the majority of my
playthrough, then switched to War Machete & Calamity Cannon once I obtained the
cannon, and finished the game with Cael Hammer & Calamity Cannon after
upgrading the Cael Hammer to max. The Army Carbine and Calamity Cannon are
absolutely overpowered, and end up one-shotting most enemies. I was actually
disappointed once I picked up the Battering Ram in the final level, because my
DPS was just straight up higher with the Calamity Cannon. There is a NG+ option
available after beating the game, so that might be nice to go back and do just
to see if it is harder.

# Update (2022-04-10)
Okay so this evening I started and completed a NG+ playthrough just for funzies
before I closed the book on this game. I mained the Cael Hammer & Calamity
Cannon for the entire run which allowed me to absolutely breeze through the
game. I'm not sure if NG+ changes the difficulty, but there was not a single
point in this run that was harder for me than my first (already super easy)
playthrough. Having the Calamity Cannon with homing rockets absolutely
trivializes every encounter in the game, and my strategy for this playthrough
was pretty much "press Y to win" in every encounter except against few enemies
that were just easier to kill with my hammer (specifically lunkheads and
anklegators).

In this playthrough I again chose to save Zulf just because I couldn't bring
myself to leave him for dead. I also chose *not* to reset the world in this
playthough, so the ending I got showed the Kid, Rucks, Zia, and Zulf all
sailing away. I'm not sure how I feel about this specific ending since Zulf has
lost the love of his life and will never get her back. During the end credits
Zulf is shown preparing some food with our squirt, but his face is filled with
grief, and I don't know if saving him after all the pain he has been through
was really the right thing to do.

In this playthrough I also went through the strangers dream, which was
definitely the hardest of all the dream sequences, but was still a cakewalk
with my hammer/cannon combo. It was nice to have a bit more content to work
through, but I was hoping for much more of a backstory in this sequence than
what was actually presented. Oh well.

So now that I've completed all of the main content in Bastion I think I am
going to be done-done with this game. I don't really see myself coming back and
doing another playthrough any time soon, mainly because the game's mechanics
are not interesting enough nor challenging enough for my liking. I enjoyed the
story and lore aspects of the game, and it was nice to casually work through
~10-12 hours of a one-shot game, so overall I think the time that I did spend
playing Bastion was a good investment.
