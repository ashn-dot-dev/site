## Big Picture Notes
Open world so large that the term "massive" cannot properly do it justice.
After dozens upon dozens of hours of exploration I **still** feel like I have
barely scratched the surface of Hyrule.
The world might be **too** large: towards the end of my play through I felt like
there was a lot of "world" to explore, but not a whole lot of new content (in
terms of game mechanics) within that world that I had not already seen.
I had the nagging feeling like the map could have (and perhaps should have) been
one fourth the size and the game world would still have been more than large
enough.

The game pops with color and is absolutely beautiful.
Many distinct areas with their own personality.
Perhaps a bit too many grassy hills, but overall I feel satisfied with the
diversity of the landscape of Hyrule.
Exploration is the main draw of BOTW and the world fully supports a mentality
where you see something interesting in the distance, say to yourself "I want to
see what that is" and then just go find it.
World exploration is almost completely player-driven and I cannot properly
express how wonderful that feels.
This might be the only game I have ever played that truly felt like an open
world: once your get off the Great Plateau there are absolutely no limits to
where you can explore and how you choose to do so.
You have these long-term goals (get to the divine beasts, complete shrines,
collect better weapons) that guide you from the minute-to-minute gameplay
exploring the world.
Korok seeds provide additional incentive to explore.
I absolutely loved the moments where I would see a big rock, say to myself "wow
I really wanna climb that rock I bet there is a Korok there".
I wanna climb the big rock moments are something I haven't felt since I was a
child, and for a game to bring that back makes me tear up.
The world is filled with literally hundreds of little places to explore and
things to do to the point that it is a bit overwhelming.
Villages feel like places people actually live in, and the ruins around Hyrule
do a good job of world building.
The world has a "calm after the storm" feeling to it: the great calamity has
happened and lots of people died, but at least now there are some small shreds
of hope that the remaining people of the land hold on to as they rebuild their
lives and their communities.
The story of this world and its people are told through environmental details
that contribute to this overall aesthetic of "Central Hyrule got turbo-fucked,
but thanks to Zelda the outer edges of civilization have returned to some
normalcy".

Movement feels fluid (outside of combat) and apart from difficulties in aiming
rock throws it feels great to interact with the world.
The world has great verticality, and climbing / parachuting around the world
feels so natural that I don't think I can play another open world game again
without wishing I had these movement options.
Once you get the motorcycle and Revali's Gale your horizontal and vertical
movement options are expanded further to the point where just moving around the
world is a game in itself.
Shield surfing is barely touched upon in the game, but it is also pretty
enjoyable.
Getting upgrades to your stamina wheel only increases your movement options
which leads to this great effect where the player levels up from via increased
knowledge about the world and its mechanics while Link levels up through the
stamina and weapon increases.

The story kind of sucks, but I don't particularly associate LoZ with good story,
so it gets a pass.
The last part of the final boss fight is a major let down as it's basically an
interactive cutscene, but I still felt a welling up of joy and childish wonder
at the end of the game on my second play through so fuck it I'm going to say I
enjoyed what little main plot there was (including the final boss fight phase).
Having all the memories in both the main game and the DLC was fun, and although
they didn't craft a particularly strong story, I think they game the characters
enough personality that I actually gave a shit about them.
Urbosa in particular was a highlight: she has the most character out of any
voiced character, and she comes off as a believable bad-ass.
Side quests were largely time wasters in my opinion, there are a few good ones.
I ignored most of the side quests that I already beat in my first play through.

The game is **way** to easy.
On master mode the tutorial area kicked by ass, but as soon as I obtained the
Soldier's Armor the game turned into baby-dumdum-easy-mode.
The Soldier's Armor is far too easy to upgrade, gives you the best defense in
the game, and is obtained at the very start of your adventure - there is even a
quest that guides you to Hateno village.
Hearty Durians absolutely break the game: once you unlock the shrine right next
to the group of Hearty Durian trees it's game over, you are invincible.
Aside from getting one shotted by a Lynel you cannot die, because anytime you
get below a safe threshold of hearts you pop another hearty dish and your are
back to above starting health.
Because I knew I could get effectively get max-hearts from food alone I was
dumped most of my spirit orbs into stamina - this was great because it made
exploring easier but it meant that combat had no gravity to it.
When there are no stakes and no way to lose I don't feel like I am ever in a
frantic battle for my life even though that is what the music is clearly
indicating.

Most shrines are trivial to beat.
The few that are truly dungeon worthy felt amazing complete, but I can count the
number of these on one hand.
Going back to the "Hyrule is way to big" point from earlier - there are 120
shrines, but there definitely didn't need to be that many, and so many of them
seem copy pasted that I again think that the game could have gotten away with
one fourth the current number it has.
Ballad shines are much of the same deal.
Some of the shrines / challenges in the game that provide challenge do so by
stripping you of all your equipment and items.
This was a blast on Eventide Island on my first play through, but on my master
mode play through I couldn't help but notice how many times the game falls
back on this as a crutch (Eventide, Master Sword Trials, Ballad Bosses).

Combat is fun for a while, but towards the end of my play through I was mostly
avoiding it.
Being super overpowered is no fun, and although the game's mechanics allow for
interesting interactions you have to make your own fun, which I just wasn't
really in a mood to do on my second play through.
Boss fights are **way** to easy - I destroyed all divine beast bosses with
absolutely zero effort, and then got my ass kicked by the Ballad Bosses because
I never had to learn their mechanics in the main game.
Gold Lynels are harder to kill than the Divine Beast boss fights.
Enemy and boss variety is lacking: I think there needed to be like three or four
more miniboss types and another three or four more fodder enemy types.
The world is so absolutely massive, but the vast majority of the game is spent
fighting the same enemies who use the same tactics and it is just so hard to
give a shit after a hundred plus hours with the game.
To add to the super-easy-mode problems, Urbosa's fury recharges super fast,
especially after getting the plus version, so most boss fights were "Urbosa's
fury, Urbosa's fury, Urbosa's fury, beat the shit out of whatever is left with
your weakest weapon and then the Master Sword."
Weapons break way too frequently: I understand that they wanted to keep the
players switching weapons, but all that the system ended up doing was creating
a Final-Fantasy-elixir-effect.
Because every weapon aside from the master sword is non-renewable, the player
is incentivized to only ever used the master sword and your weakest weapon,
meaning that ironically I had **less** actual weapon slots at the end of the
game then the beginning despite the physical number of slots being far greater.
This is doubly messed up because I barely ended up using any high powered
weapons in the final boss because they all did so much damage that it wasn't
necessary (I literally never used the Divine Pilots' weapons).
This is triple fucked, because enemies recharge health in Master mode, and the
time between last git and recharge is very small, so switching weapons isn't
worth it when you should really just be continuing to beat enemies with whatever
you are already being them with.
