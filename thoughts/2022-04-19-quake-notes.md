Quake
=====

Bought this on the Nintendo eShop for only a few bucks on 2022-04-18. I've
played a *lot* of Classic Doom over the past year (mostly on PC), and I figured
that I aught to give Quake a try since it is in that same genre of boomer
shooters. I didn't know if easy, normal, hard, and nightmare corresponded
exactly to the equivalent Doom skill levels, so I went with normal difficulty
since my original playthrough of Doom was on hurt me plenty. I went through the
four episodes in order without saves, and beat Shub-Niggurath after a couple of
days of playing during the mornings while drinking my morning coffee + evenings
after the dog settled into bed.

Overall I really enjoyed Quake. I went into the game expecting another
Doom-esque game, but was pleasantly surprised with the dramatic departure in
tone and gameplay from Doom I & II. Quake is *dark* in both the literal and
figurative sense. Almost the entirety of the game is set in dimly lit castles,
caves, sewers, and dungeons and the entire world is dripping with an oppressive
atmosphere. Classic Doom has some horror elements, but for the most part the
gameplay is all rock-n-roll kick-ass shooty fun time. In contrast, the world of
Quake makes me feel like I am a survivor, carefully creeping through a land
that has every intention of dismembering me or driving me to insanity. Quake
present a much more depressing picture of hell-like world than Doom does, and
that tonal shift is emphasised by gameplay that is not as much you killing
swathes of monsters as it is engaging in frantic bouts of survival in
encounters with enemies and traps that have a much easier time killing you than
you do of killing them.

Weapons in quake are much less powerful (with the exception of the nail gun
family) than weapons in Doom. The Doom rocket launcher can absolutely
annihilate groups of demons, but is difficult to find ammo for, and therefore
must be used strategically. The Quake grenade launcher and rocket launcher are
pretty much your primary weapons for the entire game, and there are hardly any
enemies that will go down with just one rocket. The Quake shotgun family is
pretty pathetic and mostly ends up serving a role similar to that of the pistol
in Doom I, or the pistol/shotgun (not SSG) in Doom II. The nail gun and super
nail gun are probably the best weapons in the game, but use up ammo quickly and
tend to have less ammo lying around for them (except for in episode four). The
thunderbolt is the highest DPS weapon, but you'll hardly ever find ammo for it
(except for again in episode four) and I generally had to save it for if I
encountered a shambler.

The lack of overpowered weapons is a huge contributing factor to the atmosphere
of Quake. I know that every encounter could spell death since I can't just "SSG
go brbrbrbrbrbr" a group of enemies. Most enemy encounters come in groups of
one to three monsters, but this is still more than enough to make combat
interesting. Where the fun of Doom combat comes from killing tons of monsters
in encounters with interesting combat geometry, the fun of Quake combat comes
from juggling enemy positions and avoiding attacks using Quake's more
expressive movement system. Both Doom and Quake provide interesting combat, but
the emphasis on Doom is more on the composition of enemies while the emphasis
on quake is more on survival.

Small list of good things I have to say about quake:
+ Movement in Quake feels really good. I thought having auto-run made things
  feel slippery at first, but once I got used to it I really enjoyed the act of
  navigating around.
+ The Nintendo Switch port had excellent tilt aiming controls. I usually don't
  like playing FPS game on console because controllers are so terrible, but the
  tilt aiming was spot on with in this port and I never felt like I was
  fighting with the control scheme. Way better than the Doom I and Doom II tilt
  aiming controls on Switch.
+ The soundtrack and soundtrack for this game is amazing and I was so happy to
  see that Trent Reznor worked on the sound. The music is gritty as hell, and
  the ambient noise did so much to immerse the player into lovecraftian horror
  aesthetic of the world.
+ Shamblers are super scary, both in their character design and in their
  in-game combat. Easy pick for one of the best enemy designs I've seen in a
  video game.
+ Power ups in this game are really fun to use. Quad damage especially, because
  it allows you to rampage with a shotgun and destroy everything in your path.

Small list of minor gripes I wrote down while doing my first playthrough:
+ Why does this game lag so much? Quake is like one of the first 3D accelerated
  shooters, so why is it so taxing on a console orders of magnitude more
  powerful than the PCs of 1996 with greatly improved 3D graphics capabilities?
+ This game is way to dark. When I un-docked my Switch I had to turn the
  brightness up from the default 0 to 8 before I could even make out the level
  geometry.
+ Where are all the bosses? After the E1 boss I was like "okay this fight
  taught me how to use buttons to kill the boss, I bet this will be expanded
  upon for the E2, E3, and E4 bosses". But the next boss you fight is
  Shub-Niggurath, and the mechanic never comes up again. Where are the E2, E3,
  and E4 bosses, seriously I feel jipped?
+ This game has a lot more traps than in the ID Software Classic Doom releases.
  On one hand I like that there was a greater emphasis on the environmental
  gameplay elements, but the traps started getting real predictable by the end
  of the game. I can't even count how many time there was a "hit a button and
  monster closets open" or "walk over a trigger and the floor starts moving out
  from under you" trap. By the end I was kinda over these sorts of traps and
  stopped finding them interesting.
+ Levels are really linear. To be fair most of the Doom I & II levels are
  linear too, but here the low enemy counts end up placing a spotlight on the
  linear nature because all levels end up looking like a series of small fights
  connected by hallways.
+ There area lot more "bullshit deaths" in this game than in Classic Doom.
  There was a couple of times when I literally dies in the last room because a
  door opened and I got jumped by like three enemies. Meaning I had to replay
  the whole level and was a tad bit salty about it.
+ The cast of enemies is a lot weaker than Doom II. To be fair Doom I has a
  weak cast of enemies compared to Doom II as well, so it might be the case
  that Quake II is to Quake I in enemy variety as Doom II is to Doom I.

I haven't played any of the other campaigns yet, but I definitely see myself
finishing the rest of the content in Quake. Quake is an excellent game and it
has been well worth my time and money.
