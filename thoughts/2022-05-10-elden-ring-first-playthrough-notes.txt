	+ Came in from the Altus Plateu
	+ ... Except the south entrance which I completely missed
	+ Didn't kill Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy yet since I wanted to finish the assasin quests
+ Defeated Radahn (festival activated when I touch an Altus Plateau grace I think)
+ Cleared Nokron, Eternal City & Soifra Aquaduct
	+ Got told I was not destined to open the treasure lmao
	+ I think I did this before clearing Leyndell, but I'm not 100% sure
+ Cleared Leyndell, Royal Capital (city part)
	+ Got told none may enter the elden tree
+ Scouted Forbidden Lands
+ Scouted Mountaintops of the Giants
	+ Burned my maiden at the fire cauldron thing
+ Not sure eactly the order, but I cleared Volcano manor before clearing Lyndall, Capital of Ash, but it could have been before or after fighting the fire giant
	+ Killed Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy
+ Cleared Crumbling Faram Azula
	+ Summoned for the fight against Maliketh
+ Cleared Lyndall, Capital of Ash
	+ Cleared the underground section first, but didn't interact with the Dung Eater or find the hidden entrace to see the three fingers until much later
	+ Summoned for the fight against Godfrey
	+ Summoned for the fight against Ratagon & Elden beast
	+ Beat the game with the "Mend the Elden Ring" ending
		+ Ended at lvl 116
		+ Ended with IGT of 50:42:00 (~50 hrs of playtime due to me AFKing a couple of times)
+ Cleared Caelid, Dragonbarrow, Raya Lucaria Academy, the rest of Liurnia of the Lakes, poison fort, and the eastern side of Altus Plateau + south entrance to Mt Gelmir all in a day
	+ ... Except Liurnia of the Lakes southern plateau thing you need to reach from underground
+ Cleared Forbidden Lands and Mountaintops of the Giants in a day
	+ Switched to Heavy Giant-Crusher as my main weapon
+ Cleared Mogwyn's Palace
+ Cleared Conscecrated Snowfields
+ Cleared Miquella's Haligtree
	+ Assisted Millicent, and oof those hearstrings were pulled when her questline ended and she chose to die.
	+ Summoned for the fight against Malenia, Blade of Miquella - This was actually cool because I had by big hammer, one summon had a battlemage sworcery build, and another had a katana bleed build, so I would run in and attack Malenia with my hammer, which would cause her to stun, then the bleed guy would unleash the many red swipe attack thing on the sunned Malenia while the battlemage did auxillery damage. It was actually really fun and a cool multiplayer interaction. :D
	+ NOTE: Crazy how the isolated devine tower is used for Miquella's rune since the warp at the Tower of Return made it one of the early places I visited, yet the last tower that I entered.
+ Cleared Uhl Palace Ruins (south, from Ainsel River Well Depths)
	+ One credit clear
+ Cleared Uhl Palace Ruins (north, from Ainsel River Main) / Noskella, Eternal City
	+ One credit clear
+ Cleared Lake of Blood (+ Killed Astel)
	+ Funny since earlier today I killed the harder version of this boss in the Concecrated Snowfield, so this fight was soloed first try ezpz
+ Cleared Deeproot Depths
	+ Interesting how climbing to the top of the other mausoleums (see pic) didn't let you in but this one did have that as the solution. Not saying they all need to be the same, but it felt inconsistent.
	+ Was almost a one credit clear, but I missed the landing onto one of the jumpy wind boost pads from above and the fall killed me :/, kinda lame that all the tree platforming was fine, but an easy to avoid drop down death was the thing that got me :/, Just for shits and giggles I tried the same jump again and it killed me a second time, the issue being that the area that is safe to land on is farther away than it looks from the top of the platform. Lmao there was an item on the "normal" way to drop down, so the devs probably didn't intend the player to try the jump-down-onto-jump-pad-from-above strat.
	+ Apparently the waygate at the Price of Death's Throne is supposed to be an alternate way to get to the Capital. Kinda neat. I should try that on my next run.`
+ Declared full playthrough complete at 118:00:00 IGT
	+ ... After finding all sites of grace
	+ ... After killing all bosses (I only had field bosses left that I missed)
	+ ... After killing all non-respawning NPCs
+ Lmao then later that night found out about Fringefolk Hero's grave, showing yet again how "full playthrough complete" does not mean all content has been explored :D
	+ Going back to the Stranted Graveyard grace, I now see the giant closed off arch way with the gargoyle statues lmao. I think I just totally forgot this was here after setting off on my grand adventure.
	+ Okay so killed the boss in that dungeon, and now my actual IGT completion is 119:00:00
