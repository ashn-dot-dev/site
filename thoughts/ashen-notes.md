Ashen Notes
===========

Playing on Nintendo Switch.
Game is normally $40 on the eShop, but I got it on sale for $20.
I think there is a good seed of a game here, but honestly right now I would
really only give it a 3/5.

Almost done first play through at the time I started writing this.
I am on the final boss (Sissna) after playing for roughly thirty hours, but
don't know if I care enough to beat that boss because I am just so painfully
bored of the game at this point.

## Good
I love the art style.
I much prefer a clean minimalist art style to the gritty ultra realistic art
style that a lot of souls-like games go for (The Surge, Lords of the Fallen).
There is enough detail to give the world personality without being to cluttered
or distracting.

Building the town from the ground up is very satisfying.
Seeing the down develop bit-by-bit with each quest adds to the feeling that it
is a real place filled with people who genuinely care about coming together as
a community.

Good variety of areas.
At first I was worried that all of the areas might be forest-ish themed since
the area around Vagrant's Rest looked super similar to the Eye of the Needle,
but from Sindre's View onward it has enough variety that I didn't get board of
any one area or area-theme.

Platforming is a neat idea for a souls-like game.
I don't think Ashen's platforming is very good, but this game shows that there
is potential for an open-world souls-like with heavy platforming elements, and
I hope some a game in the future will expand on the idea.

The lantern is a really fun mechanic and apart from my gripes below about it
incentivizing a one-handed playstyle I think is my favorite mechanic in Ashen.
Some areas are so dark that you genuinely *need* your lantern to get through
them.
It's like that torch mechanic from DSII that was removed in the final game, only
in Ashen it is a core part of gameplay and exploration.


## Bad
Very small pool of enemy types.

Very small of pool of weapon types.
Most weapons of the same class (one-handed-blade, one-handed-blunt,
two-handed-blade, two-handed-blunt, and spear) feel *exactly* the same.
Two-handed weapons seem to have a bit more variety but that's moot because...

Weapons are also just not satisfying to use.
There is a nice *crunch* sound effect when you land a hit, but other than that
combat doesn't feel like it has a lot of weight.
Combat gets repetitive really quickly, and by the end of the game I was not
having fun with combat interactions.

Even though the game has three main weapon types, one-handed, two-handed, and
spear, investing resources into anything but one-handed weapons is pointless.
Many areas a dark and will require you to have your lantern out.
One-handed are the only weapon type that allow you to hold your lantern as you
move around and attack.
You can put down your lantern and *then* pull out a two-handed weapon or spear,
but putting a lantern down, staying near it, and then picking it up after every
encounter is tedious as hell, so it's not worth it.

Boss battles are really lacking:
+ Ukkoto's fight felt like it came out of nowhere and had no buildup or payoff.
+ Garoran's fight was bland and uneventful.
+ Amiren's fight is the most enjoyable fight in the game and is the fight that
comes closest to a traditional Dark Souls boss.
+ Shadow of the Ashen's fight feels unfinished.
+ Sissna's fight is a huge difficulty spike compared to the rest of the game up
to that point. The big twist/reveal was cool and definitely surprised me, and
her fight is the most mechanically interesting of the bosses so far, but she
still only come in as a mid-tier boss fight in the souls series (think Iudex
Gundyr).

In general bosses also have way too much health. If the bosses had half as much
health as they currently do then I think the fights would still have the same
level of difficulty, but would be much less tedious.

Platforming is really bad.
The movement system and engine really don't feel like they fit the platforming
elements of the game.
Running and jumping is awkward, it's not clear what is and is not intended for
climbing on, and there are very few times where the platforming elements mix
with combat leading a feeling like the game is constantly switching between two
completely disjoint experiences: "It's combat time... oops now it's platform
time... oops you landed that sweet jump now back to combat...".
Sometimes the ledge grab fails to work.
sometimes you will clip into a wall and get a button prompt to climb or do a
partner assist on one pixel of the wall that you are mashing yourself against.

The only two areas that utilize the open world effectively for me were the world
sections where Sindre's View and Bronzed Mire are (not just those two locations
though I mean the entire white outlined area that they are in).
Apart from these two The Loom was the only other area that I found really
enjoyable to explore (due to it's spear-statue teleportation mechanic and
verticality).

Both of major dungeons are a chore to go through and are really not all that
fun.
I actually like that they don't have checkpoints in them because it builds a lot
of tension (the same kind you get in Dark Souls when you are deep into a part of
the world with a ton of souls and low Estus and don't know whether you should
press on or not because you don't know how further it is to safety).
But both of these dungeons are way to long and after you've gone through a
portion of them once it is tedious to go through that section again to get back
to where you were.
I was lucking in that I found a secret path to the bottom in the first dungeon,
but when I went back to use the long-route just to see how it is I was so bored
by the time I got to the checkpoint before the boss.
The second dungeon has a massive problem in that the hallways all look and play
the same, so it feels like a 30 min gauntlet of doing the same rooms over and
over again.
This highlights a bigger problem with the game in that although I've been
playing for just under 30hrs at this point, probably only 15 of those were fresh
content.

Steals a lot of the items from Dark Souls. This is fine, but it doesn't add
enough outside of that to feel like it has an identity of it's own in the item
department.
Potions are this game's one unique element, and while I like that it tried to do
something a little different by having light crafting, the system is tedious to
use (buying, preparing, and managing ingredients) so I didn't end up using it
all to much.

Main hand and off hand are not taken out by default when you leave the town.
I've gotten hit more than once because I tried to raise a shield that was not
taken out.

Loot variety is extremely lacking.
I used one weapon for about half of the game and then switched to what was
basically a better version at whatever-the-fuck-bandit's-pass.
There is no need to upgrade any more weapons than one since they're all
basically the same, so I very quickly leveled my weapon to max power and then
had no use for weapon forging materials for the rest of the game.
Unfortunately there is no unique loot or anything else really interesting to
pick up in the world so the entire back half of the game was me exploring areas
and finding crafting materials that I did not need and *occasionally* a piece
of armor or a weapon that I also did not need.
This lack of loot makes exploring a chore.
I am the kind of person who likes to 100% explore every part of a world,
especially in souls like games, but where as Dark Souls has some interesting
items with lore attached throughout the game, Ashen has none of that, so loot
pickups are almost always a disappointment.

The AI isn't too horrible, but has a tendency to fall off of cliffs and die
which gets really frustrating 4th or 5th time it happens.
I wish the game was built around a single player experience first because as it
stands, having the AI as a companion is a crapshoot as to whether they will end
up being genuinely useful as company in combat or the any% world record holder
for jumping off of a cliff.
