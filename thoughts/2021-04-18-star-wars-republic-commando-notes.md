Star Wars Republic Commando Notes
=================================

Purchased for $15 on Nintendo Switch after seeing it in the "Best Sellers"
category while browsing the eShop last week. Just finished a full playthrough
on the hard difficulty setting. Although I played this game on PC as a kid I
had never actually finished the game until today, so I was seeing a majority of
the game's content for the first time.

Overall the port to the Switch was alright. I remember the game being kind of
clunky on PC, and this switch port was no different. Movement and aiming was
kind of stiff, but the controls all mapped nicely onto the Switch controller.
The Switch has fewer buttons that there are inputs on PC, so I think that some
of the functionality was stripped away: for instance there was no "form up"
button on the controller (although there was a setting to auto form up at what
I assume were scripted triggers), and you would automatically swap to the
pistol when you ran out of ammo rather that being able to swap to it any time.

Back in 2005 I remember the graphics looking really good, and to my surprise
they actually held up pretty well. Usually this early 2000s games age pretty
poorly due to the low poly counts and weird 2000s trend of having really dark
lighting everywhere, but Republic Commando still looks excellent.

The commando squad contains an engaging cast of characters that all provided
distinct (even if a little one-note) personalities and dialog. The writing and
execution of dialog in-game was enough to keep me invested in campaign.
However, the actual campaign missions themselves were, for the most part, not
engaging. The writing was serviceable, but it felt like there was a disconnect
between the writers and level designers, almost as if the levels were designed
first and then the writers needed to figure out a way to move the commandos
around these environments. This is nowhere more apparent then in the Kashyyyk
campaign where you spend about half the campaign running around a bunch of
corridors and the other half of the campaign moving around a different set of
corridors (and one nice open bridge area) with the director saying "we need to
help the Wookiees here" or "we need to secure this bla bla bla in the hangar"
with little tangible context for your actions.

In fact the game as a whole sort of bottomed out towards the end. The first
campaign (Geonosis) had a good variety of areas, clear goals with good story
context for your gameplay actions, and just about the perfect runtime. The
second campaign (Prosecutor ship) was the absolute highlight of the story and
had a really nice narrative arc. The third campaign (Kashyyyk) felt repetitive
to play, didn't have very strong narrative structure, and stretched on for
*way* to long. Towards the end of the Kashyyyk campaign I was saying to myself
"okay when are we going to wrap this up" which was made doubly bad by one of
the most abrupt endings I have ever seen in a shooter. You spend the last
mission of the game getting each member of your squad onto turrets surrounding
a Separatist ship and, in the span of three minutes, the focus of the narrative
goes from blowing up the ship, to killing of your squad mate 07, to debating
whether you should rescue him, to saying "fuck it" and giving you the epilogue,
before finally rolling the credits. Randomly killing off a main character and
then rolling the credits would be bad enough, but doing so at the end of what
felt like a slog of a campaign really left a bad taste in my mouth.

On a more positive note - the atmosphere of the game is fantastic. The game does
a great job of placing you in the Star Wars universe through excellent world
design and I have to give massive props to the level designers for providing a
consistently excellent theming though each individual campaign. The best
example of this comes from the Prosecutor campaign. The campaign begins as
survival horror, and slowly transitions into a "we're outnumbered and
outgunned" fight to reclaim the ship, ending with a absolutely nerve wracking
final stand against a ton of heavy battle droids under a tight timer.

Actually now that I think about it, Republic Commando does a great job all
around of placing you into stressful situations with tight timing or resource
constraints (except for maybe the latter half of the Kashyyyk campaign). There
were plenty of times where I felt under duress as my squad mates were
attempting to complete objectives on low health while being given support from
the rest of the team. It might also have been due to me playing on hard
difficulty, but there were also plenty of scenarios where I did *not* have an
abundance of resources, and felt a real pressure to make shots count
(especially during the Prosecutor campaign when retaking the ship's hangars).
I really enjoy games that provide this kind of stressful-yet-fair difficulty
and I honestly think Republic Commando is one of the best examples I have seen
in this regard.

The game suffers from the elixir effect pretty badly, or at least it did for me
playing on hard difficulty. You have four weapon slots each with their own ammo
reserve: assault rifle, sniper rifle, grenade launcher, and fourth misc. weapon
slot that you can fill with guns you pick up off the ground. Unfortunately, the
super battle droid and spider enemies are absolute damage sponges, and the only
weapons that are really useful against them are the sniper rifle and grenade
launcher, respectively. So you will spend most of the game never barely using
your sniper rifle and grenade launcher just in case these enemies appear which
really sucks because these weapons are really satisfying to use (good game
feel). Use of grenades sometimes also falls into the elixir effect, but the game
gives you enough grenades that you don't ever really feel like you *need* to
hold off on using them, especially since grenade interactions play an integral
role in tactical combat similar to how grenades functions in Halo.

The game also suffers from the player character being built out of papier-mâché.
Again this might have been more to do with me playing on hard difficulty, but I
was often finding that my health would be drained after just a few hits. I would
often times die out of nowhere from enemies that I did not know were even there
(especially Geonosians) which made those deaths kind of cheap. I think that your
squad mates might *not* have the same health modifiers as you because it seemed
like they could take a lot more punishment before going down. The tankiness of
your squad in conjunction with the overpowered grenade and sniper positions you
could order them to use meant that a lot of my playthrough was spent in the back
lines providing grenade support rather than directly engaging firefights. This
might not totally be a bad thing though because having the player character make
positioning decisions and provide supporting fire & grenades while the rest of
the squad executes orders (slicing & demolitions & sniper/grenade cover
positions) *did* actually do a good job of making us all feel like an actual
team, so maybe game design mission accomplished?

Overall I thought the game was worth the money I spent on it, and I am glad to
have *finally* beaten the game. If I ever do play again I think I will play on
normal difficulty, but I'm not sure if the game actually holds enough replay
value to merit another playthrough.
