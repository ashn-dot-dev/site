Elden Ring
==========

After something like three years away from PC gaming I went out and bought a
brand new (pre-built because I don't really care that much anymore) monster of
a gaming PC for pretty much the sole purpose of playing Elden Ring. Although
I've been hyped for Elden Ring's release for a while, I had specifically
avoided any and all spoilers (except for watching the trailers), reviews,
memes, and other related content so that I could have the best first
playthrough experience. It's a special occasion when a Soulslike game is
released by FromSoftware, and a first playthough is only something you get to
do once. It took me a couple months after the games release before I was
comfortable spending the money on a new PC, but once I had the equipment I
absolutely tore through this game.

On 2022-04-23 my friend (we will call them D) and I had a hangout day where we
got brunch (it turned out we were wearing literally the exact same shirt lmao),
drove to Micro Center, and picked out my machine. This rig has an i7-12700KF
GeForce RTX 3070 Ti with 8GB of VRAM, a 1 TB SSD main drive, and another 2 TB
SSD that I will use for long-term storage (still need to format the disk...). I
purchased Elden Ring that same day, and hung out with D where they watched me
do some of the tutorial area while we chatted about the what is new and what
has changed from previous Souls games.

D and I are both long-time fans of the Souls series. D has played through Dark
Souls 1 and 3 as well as Bloodborn, and I have put hundreds upon hundreds of
hours into Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3, and I actually used to do casual NG+7
speedruns for DS3 for fun. D had been playing Elden Ring since launch, but had
not yet completed the game, and we were both excited to be able to do some
co-op together now that I was back on PC.

Okay so here is the part where I talk about how I have been *obsessed* with
this game for the past few weeks. I had a bad habit of starting a Souls game
and obsessing over it to the point where it basically takes over my entire
life. I'm not exactly proud that that obsession, but these games come out
infrequently enough that it usually doesn't end up becoming a crippling
problem. Dark Souls 3 released when I was still in university, and on the week
that the game came out I skipped all classes, did not work on any assignments,
and ended up spending ~30 hours on my first full playthough of the game. 30
hours over a couple of days is a pretty alarming amount of time to spend
playing a video game, but Elden Ring ended up blowing those figures out of the
water. Elden Ring is an absolutely massive game, and my first full playthrough
took ~120 hours over a two-ish week period, completely dwarfing the first
playthough time of Dark Souls 3. Elden Ring has more areas to explore, more
dungeons, more NPCs, more bosses, more challenges, more quests, just more of
everything compared to previous Souls games that I have played. The size and
scale of Elden Ring's open world is absolutely breathtaking, and I devoured it.

For the past two-ish weeks my day have looked like:
+ Wake up
+ Walk & feed dog
+ Eat a bowl of cereal
+ Play Elden Ring over morning coffee
+ Go to work
+ Walk & feed dog after work
+ Eat a bowl of cereal
+ Play Elden Ring until late hours of the night
+ Repeat
This is schedule was basically min-maxing my life to optimize for the amount of
time that I could spend playing Elden Ring. Like I said, I'm not happy that I
work this way, but I working like this allowed me to beat the final boss of the
game in under a week, and complete all areas of the game in just over two
weeks. I was constantly updating D with my progress as I went though the game,
and it was absolutely hilarious seeing their reaction to me surpassing them in
level and progress throughout the game when they had an almost two month head
start on me. :D

I'm pretty sure that I did my first playthrough completely wrong. Early on I
found a chest that teleports you from the starting area to Caelid, a mid-game
area that I was way under leveled for. Instead of going back to the starting
area, I said "okay I guess we are doing this now" and proceeded to explore most
of this mid-game area plus the Dragon Barrow while hilariously underpowered.
That stubborn doing-things-out-of-order attitude ended up becoming the theme of
this run. After running around Caelid, I explored the weeping peninsula where
I acquired the Grafted Blade Greatsword that would end up becoming my main
weapon through the playthrough. I like to do my first playthrough of Souls
games with a strength build because bonking enemies fun, and a strength build
does not have to worry about missing potentially critical spells/incantations
in a blind run. Apparently strength builds are not really that great in Elden
Ring as compared to previous Souls games, but this weapon certainly was enough
to carry me to the end credits, and I had a *lot* of fun with its moveset.
Back from the weeping peninsula, I cleared Stormveil Castle, fought Godrick the
Grafted, and then proceeded to skip basically the entirety of the Liurnia Of
The Lakes by running around the side and parkouring off of cliffs to the other
side of the bridge. By this point I had found both halves of the Dectus
Medallion just from my time exploring, so without realizing it I had already
obtained the items I needed to use the Grand Lift of Dectus. I took the lift,
up walked my scrawny under leveled self to the capital, only to be told that I
needed more great runes to enter, so I said "fine whatever" and fought General
Radahn for my second great rune. I have actual notes on this stuff back on the
windows PC (now saved as `elden-ring.txt`), but I also killed the volcano snake
boss for his great rune too somewhere in there. Anyway after clearing the
capital and being told that I couldn't enter their tree fort, I was off to the
mountains. Buuuut, here is where it gets interesting: I had a flight to PDX
that I needed to catch in a couple of days, and didn't want to leave my game
without being it, so I proceeded to basically run past everything in the rest
of the game in order to reach the end credits before the day of my flight. TLDR
I ended up seeing the credits roll after ~50 hours with most of the games
contents still unexplored.

After returning home, I spent the next ~60 hours finishing the content that I
skipped while running through areas. There were lots of dungeons (small and
legacy) a bunch of unexplored areas, the entirety of the Consecrated Snowfield
and the Haligtree areas, and more. At this point in the game I switched from
the Grafted Greatsword to the Giant-Crusher for increased bonking. This portion
of the run was a lot of fun because it was me mostly being overpowered for
lower level areas, and I was able to go for long stretches without ever resting
a grace.

After clearing the vast majority of the games content, I spent the last ~10
hours experimenting with different builds and helping players during co-op. In
my post game, I really enjoyed Ranni's quest line, and decided that it could be
fun to experiment with a battle mage build based around Ranni's weapon and
sorcery, so I am now rocking a Darkmoon Greatsword build with that uses Ranni's
Dark Moon + Buffed Darkmoon Greatsword R2s with buffs from talismans and the
Jellyfish Shield in increase damage. This build is really fun, and I think it
is what I will carry over for a NG+ run whenever I get around to doing that.

So after ~120 hours (the exact number is actually 119 hours on the dot), I've
explored every area of this game (I think), killed every boss (I think), killed
every non-respawning NPC, and completed remaining quests, so I am now satisfied
with my first playthrough. Because I did things so out of order I ended up
being unable to complete a lot of quests, but that's just the nature of a blind
playthrough, so my NG+ will be dedicated to finishing all quests and playing
the game the default intended way.

Misc. Notes In No Particular Order
----------------------------------
+ Lots of bosses are reused, or are just normal enemies with boss health bars.
  This is especially bad in minor dungeons which are kind of a letdown in
  general. How many times was the Ulcerated Tree Spirit used? There are some
  really good bosses in this game, but this all these lame ones end up brining
  the average down.
+ Minor dungeons feel like a bunch of copy paste rooms, similar to a Skyrim
  dungeon. I was happy to play through these on my first run, but I think I
  will skip them for future runs.
+ I've seen the same two-shack asset used everywhere in this game. There are a
  lot of duplicate / reused assets in general, but I think that is because the
  size and scope of this game might have slightly outside the comfortable range
  for From. Re-using assets is super common in games, but some of the uses here
  made me think that the game got out just barely over the threshold to not
  make things feel too samey.
+ Platforming is neat. I actually like it in this game. This feels like the
  first Souls game where platforming was done right.
+ Lag spikes in this game are terrible. This beefed up PC was regularly seeing
  pauses and frame drops in some areas. In a game with platforming and input
  sensitive doge rolling, these lag spikes are just unacceptable, and ended up
  getting me killed a couple of times. From is known for having bad PC ports,
  but I am really disappointed that this beefed up PC with all settings cranked
  down to low *still* experiences such frequent frame rate issues.
+ I really like the depth of the quests in this game. They feel like they are a
  lot more meaty than in previous souls games. A good amount of that might be
  from just how expansive Ranni's quest is. That being said, the massive open
  world of Elden Ring is a much poorer fit for the Souls quest model than the
  more linear Dark Souls games, and I think there is basically no way one would
  ever be able to figure out how to complete all these quests on their own. I
  tried to stay away from the wiki on my first full playthrough, but I had to
  look up how to do every single quest because there is no way I would be able
  to complete these quests without a guide.
+ I love how this game continues with the model of "if you can see it you can
  go to it" from the souls games. The shape of this world really helps this and
  I absolutely love it.
+ The mechanic where killing groups of enemies on the field areas refills
  flasks is great. The mechanic allows me to go for long exploration benders
  where I will clear entire sections of the map and touch like 5+ graces
  without ever sitting down to rest I am glad they disable this in dungeons, so
  that I can have a proper souls challenge, but allowing it on the overworld is
  great!
+ Some attacks will knock you down with no chance to recover before taking
  additional damage. Some examples come from Radagon's attacks. A lot of bosses
  also beyblade in this game, so having a boss spin jump around the arena for
  five minutes, knock me down, and then kill be before I can recover feels
  cheap.
+ Alexander's quest line was bugged for me, and he got stuck at Radahn. I could
  only get the lesser version of his talisman for my final build because there
  was no way to progress him :(.
+ The open world of this game obviously means that there are multiple ways to
  reach an objective, but even within major dungeons there are often multiple
  ways to reach an objective. A particularly good example of this is the Prayer
  Room grace and following area, where there were many different ways to
  traverse through to the next grace. Often times when moving the play can
  choose whether to engage in combat as well - my "speedrun through the game"
  strats worked because I had the freedom to not engage with certain groups of
  enemies and even some field bosses. I also count at least three different
  ways to get past the lake area onto the plateau and I would not be surprised
  if there was a fourth way that I have not found yet!
+ I have a feeling I still missed a ton of content in this game. I got all the
  way to the bottom of Nokron way before Ranni's questline started, and I
  didn't even realize there was an entire other building with the mimic tear in
  it. How many more areas like this have I completely missed where I just
  walked past an important area or entrance?
+ I am glad this game has a map. The Dark Souls series would have been worse
  off with a map, but it fits perfectly for Elden Ring. When I acquire a map
  piece, I mark points of interest and when I visit them I remove the markers,
  which leads to an overall better way to make sure I'm seeing everything in
  the world. I think the size and scale of this game made the map a necessity
  this time around.
+ This game has secret passageways within secret passageways. The amount of
  hidden and/or optional content is staggering
+ Inventory sorting is amazing, especially for reading lore of recently picked
  up items.
+ Fighting the original versions of bosses after fighting there beefed up
  version is kinda lame. I fought the hard version of Astel in the Consecrated
  Snowfields before fighting the earlier version in the underground and it was
  really weird that the first version of Astel has huge buildup with multiple
  areas you have to traverse, but the harder version of him is just at the
  bottom of some cave??? Why? Were they really that short on content that they
  needed to do this?
+ The zombified merchants playing their instrument has an animation that
  matches the music they are playing (including vibrato)!
+ This game seems to use the same flavor of the engine as DS3. DS1->DS3 feels
  like a much greater leap than DS3->ER in terms of engine look and feel. I'm
  sure that there were a ton of behind-the-scenes changes, but overall I was
  able to treat this game as DS3 + open world. And that's okay, I think DS3 had
  a winning engine formula, so using that formula is all good by me.
+ The lore of this game is much more approachable than the Souls series.
+ This game has the best world-exploration of any Souls game I have played,
  period. This has been the most fun I have ever had sightseeing and exploring
  within a Souls world, and I loved every minute of it. But it is also so much
  world to see that I think it will be a long time before I can do another full
  playthrough, just because that sightseeing seems like it will require over a
  hundred hours for a full playthrough.
+ This game has beautiful vista after beautiful vista. Lots of genuinely
  beautiful areas to look at in this game, and you can tell the developers put
  a lot of work into setting up some of these views.
+ I had to keep sticky notes on my TODOs because you have to treat exploring
  like a stack of things to do. There each exploration branch leads to
  sub-branches of exploration, that by the mid game I felt it necessary to
  write down what I wanted to do or things that seemed interesting so that I
  could come back to them later after I had forgotten about them.
+ I played this game somewhat out of order, but I really want to know what is
  the limit to the out of otherness. How much of this game is it possible to
  skip without glitches? I know you need the two great runes, need to fight
  some bosses near the first & second encounters in Leyndell, and need to fight
  the fire giant, but I can't really thing of many other areas or sections of
  the game that require you to fight bosses to get past them. I would love to
  do my own minimum-bosses run of this game.
+ The crafting system didn't really land with me. I barely ever used it, and in
  future playthroughs I think I'll skip picking up all of the materials as I
  ride around.

First Impressions and Review-ish Thoughts
-----------------------------------------
So I knew I was going to love this game: I am such a huge Souls fan, and this
is just a bigger, badder, open world Dark Souls. I think that this world is
beautiful and fun to explore, I think the mix of dungeons and field roaming is
a really nice fit for the genre, and I (unexpectedly) really enjoy the newly
emphasized jumping mechanics. When ER is at its best it is the most wonderful
experience, and my ~120 hours of playtime over a two-ish week period should be
evidence enough that this game is a good value.

But there are weak points in this game. The performance problems are a serious
issue. The minor dungeons were disappointing, and they are something that I
won't feel bad about skipping in the future. Bosses like Radagon and Malenia
are really fun to fight, but beyblading bosses like Ulcerated Tree Spirit,
normal-enemy-with-a-bos-healthbar bosses like the Abductor Virgins, and the
repeated bosses like Putrid Avatar all taint the boss roster. I think ER was
just slightly out of the scope of what From could comfortable implement and you
can see the places where they were stretched for content.

That being said, if you remove all of the disappointing parts of this game,
then what is left is still a full game the is well worth the time that I put
into it. I don't know if this will end up being my favorite Souls game of all
time, but I really *really* enjoyed my time with it, and I am excited to do my
NG+ run (in smalls chunks rather than 7+ hours of day for two-ish weeks...).

9/10, ez game

# Update (2022-08-20)
Okay so over the past couple of months I've played some Elden Ring on and off
and have now completed six journeys with my `ashn` character. I wrote about the
first journey above. The second, third, and fourth journeys were speedruns (of
which the fourth journey was sub-two-hours), the fifth journey was a
do-all-the-quests speedrun following the TLDR NPC questline steps roundtable
guide, and the sixth journey was a speedrun for the frenzied flame ending in
order to pick up the last achievement for the game. After over 185 hours with
this character and this game, I have much less favorable view of Elden Ring. I
still think ER is and amazing game with probably the best visuals of the
series, but the game has some really souring aspects that have left me with
mixed feelings about the overall game package as well as the future of the
souls series in general.

For starters, ER suffers terribly in its third act from a late-game string of
bad bosses. Fire Giant is a *terribly* designed boss. Like... I am baffled at
how Fire Giant made it into the final game. He has all the problems that large
bosses have had in the souls series, but his gigantic health bar coupled with
some really devastating (often times one-shotting) attacks leave little room
for error in an exhaustingly long fight that just is not fun to participate in.
Godskip Duo uses recycled bosses who both have gamepad-reading AI. Maliketh has
the speed of a Bloodborne boss with some absolutely bullshit
clipping-through-walls-and-pillars attacks, and he spends so much time
beyblading around the arena that it feels less like two foes in combat and more
like a waiting game where you sit around during 30 second long acrobatic
flurries so that you can finally have "your turn" to attack. Gideon Ofnir is
not offensively bad, but the fight feels out of place and is maybe a bit too
easy. Hoarah Loux and Radagon are great fights with some bad moments, and
overall I think they would have been nice to end the game with, but... Elden
Beast is one of my least favorite bosses is a souls game *ever*. In fact it
might be *the* worst fight in a souls game. Maybe I'm bitter and my opinion
will change later, but having Elden Beast a final boss of an epic 100+ hour
journey or 2+ hour speedrun is equally disappointing. I wanted to take this
character all the way to a NG+7 run, but thinking about having to fight Fire
Giant, Maliketh, and Elden Beast at least two more times makes it hard to
justify committing to the runs.

Another issue is that ER is just too fucking big. I don't necessarily mean in
terms of map size, I think the whole package has too much content. My
do-all-the-quests run took ~30 hours and that was with an already leveled
character with all map pieces unlocked and map locations discovered running
straight lines from point to point ticking off items on the checklist. It is
*exhausting* to complete a full playthrough of this game, and I honestly do not
have the time to commit to another full run. And I think it is this size that
leads to a lot of the problems I talked about in my initial review. Repeated
bosses and copy-paste dungeons? With so much game that might have been the best
option to fill the world. Beyblading bosses that move too fast? Probably some
bad design choices, but I imagine they might not have had as much time to
balance with all the world that needed populating. Bad lag spikes everywhere?
Well ya the world is huge and is probably an optimization nightmare. The size
of the world also breaks the traditional souls formula in unexpected ways; I
didn't about this during my first playthrough, but many reviewers noted how
bonkers it is that the quest progression in this game expects you to find NPCs
all across this massive world as they change locations. Like without a guide
there is absolutely no way I was going to be able to complete all these quests,
or in many case even *find* where some of these NPCs move to. This section is a
bit rambly, but basically I think that ER is the size of three AAA games with
the polish of one.

I still think ER is a wonderful game, and I'm sure I'll come back to it with a
more favorable attitude after a few months. I don't think I would be so
critical if I didn't have a genuine love for these games. After spending nearly
200 hours with ER it is hard *not* to see its flaws, and I do not necessarily
think that those flaws should ruin the experience for me as a whole forever
into the future. But I am worried... it feels like the team bit off more than
they could chew, and I wonder if ER will set the standard for what fans expect
out of the series. I would actually like the souls game to return to smaller
and more intimate settings like the compact yet interconnected world design of
DS1. I think ER does a lot off neat things, but if future games continue in the
direction that ER has started then I am going to find it harder and harder to
enjoy this series. ER is not my favorite in From Software Souls line of games,
and that gives me a lot of mixed emotions. :(
