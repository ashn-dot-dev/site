<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  Hi I'm ashn.
  I am a professional software developer and hobbyist hardware tinkerer with an
  interest in systems programming, embedded development, and programming
  language design.
  I am currently employed as an software engineer in the automotive industry
  working on charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. Outside of work I
  enjoy creating free and open source software for POSIX systems, some of which
  I blog about on this site.
</p>

<h2>Quick Information for Potential Employers</h2>
<p>
  I have over half a decade of experience writing C as a hobbyist and over
  three years of experience writing C and C++ in a professional setting. I have
  spent a little over two years at my current company writing C (embedded), C++,
  Python (mainly tools), and lots and lots of shell scripts. I tend to work
  primarily on and with Linux-based platforms, although I do have <i>some</i>
  experience with application development for Windows Desktop, and I
  (unfortunately) maintain our Windows CI infrastructure. I run Linux (usually
  some flavor of Debian) on my personal machines and cloud instances, but would
  be comfortable working in other POSIX environments.

<h3>Selected Projects</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/ash-nolan/sunder">The Sunder Programming Language</a>:
    Work in progress C-like systems programming language for x86-64 Linux.
    Written in in C99 with some NASM-flavored x86-64 assembly. Generates static
    binaries for x86-64 Linux with no dependency on libc. This has been my
    primary side project for the past 8 or so months. The project just had its
    first release which you can read about in
    <a href="/blog/2021-10-05-i-wrote-a-compiler-for-my-own-programming-language.html">this blog post</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/ash-nolan/autil">autil</a>:
    Set of header-only libraries containing data structures and algorithms for
    rapid application development in C99. Includes utilities for arbitrary
    precision integer arithmetic, managed strings, interned strings, bit-arrays,
    stretchy buffers, generic tree-maps, generic lists, a minimal unit testing
    library, a minimal 2D game engine, and much more! Written in C99. This is
    an updated-as-needed project that provides a base set of utilities for use
    in my other projects.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/ash-nolan/braille-apple">Braille Apple</a>:
    My most recent mini-project. Renders
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Apple!!">Bad Apple!!</a>
    in the terminal using Unicode braille patterns. This is an example of a
    quick one-off project thrown together in a night, kind of as a meme.
    Rendering Bad Apple through obscure and esoteric methods is popular within
    the demoscene and as far as I could tell no one has produced a rendering
    using braille patterns until now. Here is a
    <a href="https://vimeo.com/636580388">side-by-side comparison</a> of the
    original video (left) and my render (right) for those who are interested.
