<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  Hi I'm ashn.
  I am a professional software developer and hobbyist hardware tinkerer with
  interest in systems programming, embedded development, and programming
  language design.
  I am currently working as an embedded software engineer in the automotive
  industry working on charging infrastructure for electric vehicles.
  Outside of work I enjoy creating tooling for POSIX systems, some of which I
  blog about on this site.
</p>

<p>
  I am a strong supporter of free and open source software.
  My open source projects are released under a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-domain-equivalent_license">
    public-domain-equivalent license
  </a>
  whenever possible.
  Attribution for my work is appreciated, but not legally required.

<h2>Software I Use</h2>
<p>
  The majority of my machines run Debian-based Linux distributions.
  Debian's package management system is exceptionally stable and generally
  contains packages for whatever software I may need.
  I tend to hop between desktop environments and will usually stick with
  whatever terminal emulator and file manager come as defaults with the system.
  <br>
  Additional software I use daily includes:
  <ul>
    <li>Bash (shell)</pre>
    <li>Clang (C compiler)</li>
    <li>Clang-format (C/C++ code formatting)</li>
    <li>Firefox (web browser)</li>
    <li>GDB with <code>--tui</code> (debugger)</li>
    <li>Make (build system)</li>
    <li>Vim (text editor)</li>
  </ul>
</p>
