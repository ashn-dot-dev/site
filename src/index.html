<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I am a professional software developer with an interest in systems
  programming, programming education, and programming language design.
</p>
<p>
  I am currently employed as a full-stack developer within the renewables
  industry. Previously, I worked as a compiler developer on a domain-specific
  language and runtime for caching systems, and before that as a software
  developer in the automotive industry focusing on charging infrastructure for
  electric vehicles.
</p>
<p>
  In my free time I enjoy creating free and open source software for POSIX
  systems, some of which I blog about on this site. Some of my major
  projects include <a href="https://github.com/ashn-dot-dev/sunder">Sunder</a>,
  a modest systems programming language that aims to be a pleasant middle
  ground between C and higher-level systems languages such as C++ or Rust;
  <a href="https://github.com/ashn-dot-dev/lumpy">Lumpy</a>, a scripting
  language with value semantics intended for use in teaching and as a
  prototyping tool; <a href="https://github.com/ashn-dot-dev/natac">Natac</a>,
  a networked
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan">Settlers of Catan</a>
  clone, as well as a smattering of other projects and small experiments which
  can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/ashn-dot-dev">GitHub</a>.
