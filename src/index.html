<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  Hi I'm ashn.
  I am a professional software developer and hobbyist hardware tinkerer with an
  interest in systems programming, embedded development, and programming
  language design.
  I am currently employed as an embedded software engineer in the automotive
  industry working on charging infrastructure for electric vehicles.
  Outside of work I enjoy creating free and open source software for POSIX
  systems, some of which I blog about on this site.
