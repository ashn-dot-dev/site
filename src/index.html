<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I am a professional software developer and hobbyist hardware tinkerer with
  a love for all things free and open source.
  At my day job I spend most of my time working in the areas of systems
  programming and embedded development.
  Outside of work I enjoy developing tooling for POSIX systems, hacking together
  small hardware projects, and exploring field of programming language design.
