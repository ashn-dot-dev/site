<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I am a professional software developer with an interest in systems
  programming, embedded development, and programming language design.
</p>
<p>
  I am currently employed full-time as a compiler developer working on a
  domain-specific language and runtime for caching systems. Previously, I was
  employed as a software engineer in the automotive industry working on
  charging infrastructure for electric vehicles.
</p>
<p>
  In my free time I enjoy creating free and open source software for POSIX
  systems, some of which I blog about on this site. My main project outside of
  work is
  <a href="https://github.com/ashn-dot-dev/sunder">Sunder</a>, a modest
  systems programming language that aims to be a pleasent middle ground between
  C and higher-level systems languages such as C++ or Rust. Another project I
  actively devlop in my free time is
  <a href="https://github.com/ashn-dot-dev/natac">Natac</a>, a networked
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan">Settlers of Catan</a> clone
  written in Sunder. A smattering of other projects and small experiments can
  be found on my <a href="https://github.com/ashn-dot-dev">GitHub</a>.
