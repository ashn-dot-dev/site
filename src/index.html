<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  Hi I'm ashn.
  I am a professional software developer and hobbyist hardware tinkerer with an
  interest in systems programming, embedded development, and programming
  language design.
  I am currently employed as a software engineer in the automotive industry
  working on charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. Outside of work I
  enjoy creating free and open source software for POSIX systems, some of which
  I blog about on this site.
</p>

<h2>Information for Potential Employers</h2>
<p>
  I have over half a decade of experience writing C as a hobbyist and over three
  years of experience writing C and C++ in a professional setting. I have spent
  the last two years at my current company writing C (embedded), C++, Python
  (mainly tools), and lots and lots of shell scripts. I tend to work primarily
  on and with Linux-based platforms, although I do have <i>some</i> experience
  with application development for Windows Desktop, and I maintain our Windows
  CI infrastructure. I run Linux (usually some flavor of Debian) on my personal
  machines and cloud instances, but would be comfortable working in other POSIX
  environments.

<h3>Selected Projects</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/ash-nolan/sunder">The Sunder Programming Language</a>:
    Work in progress C-like systems programming language for x86-64 Linux.
    Written in C99 with some NASM-flavored assembly. This has been my primary
    side project for the past 8 or so months. The project recently had its
    first release which you can read about in
    <a href="/blog/2021-10-05-i-wrote-a-compiler-for-my-own-programming-language.html">this blog post</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/ash-nolan/autil">Autil</a>:
    Set of header-only libraries containing data structures and algorithms for
    rapid application development in C99. Includes utilities for arbitrary
    precision integer arithmetic, managed strings, interned strings, bit-arrays,
    stretchy buffers, generic tree-maps, generic lists, a minimal unit testing
    library, a minimal 2D game engine, and much more! Written in C99. This is
    an updated-as-needed project that provides a base set of utilities for use
    in my other projects.

  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/ash-nolan/braille-apple">Braille Apple</a>:
    One of my recent mini-projects. Renders
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Apple!!">Bad Apple!!</a>
    in the terminal using braille patterns. This is an example of a quick
    one-off project thrown together in a night, kind of as a meme. Rendering
    Bad Apple through obscure and esoteric methods is popular within the
    demoscene, as is the case with this project where frames are rendered
    using characters from the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_Patterns">Unicode Braille Patterns Block</a>.
    Here is a
    <a href="https://vimeo.com/636580388">side-by-side comparison</a> of the
    original video (left) and my render (right) for those who are interested. I
    had so much fun with this mini-project that I went on to create an entire
    <a href="https://github.com/ash-nolan/braille-pattern-graphics">
      2D graphics library
    </a> in Python for drawing/rendering images using braille patterns.
