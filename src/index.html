<h1>ASHN'S PERSONAL WEBSITE</h1>
<p>
  Hello and welcome to my personal website.
  <br><br>

  I am a professional software developer and hobbyist hardware tinkerer with
  a love for free and open source software/hardware.
  At my day job I spend most of my time working in the areas of systems
  programming and embedded development.
  Outside of work I enjoy developing tooling for Unix-like systems, hacking
  together small projects on open source hardware (mainly Arduino), and
  exploring field of programming language design.
  <br><br>

  Stay hydrated.
