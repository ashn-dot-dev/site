Two cookie sheets covered in parchment paper filled with twenty five blobs of a
brown oat mixture. The mixture appears to be mostly comprised of oats, with a
chocolatey semi-liquid filling the spaces between individual oats.

Simple no-bake cookies that only take a few minutes to prepare. When I was a
kid, my mother would frequently make these. She called them "Cat Shit Cookies",
which is what I still refer to them as today.

## Ingredients

+ 1/2 cup of milk
+ 1/4 cup of butter
+ 1/4 cup of cocoa
+ 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract
+ 2 cups of sugar
+ 1/3 cup of peanut butter
+ 3 cups of rolled oats

## Instructions

1. Whisk the milk, butter, and cocoa together in a sauce pan over medium heat
   until the butter melts.
2. Add the sugar and continue whisking until the mixture comes to a boil.
3. Add vanilla, and let boil for one and a half minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Add oats and blend with a wooden spoon until all of the oats are completely
   covered.
5. Spoon the chocolaty oat mixture onto cookie sheets covered with wax paper
   and let cool.

## Notes

My partner and I did not have a fully stocked baking pantry when making these
for the first time, so we substituted two cups of sugar with one cup of raw
honey, and substituted the half cup of milk with a half cup of coconut milk.
The results were *just alright*: the cookies were a bit softer than I would
have liked, but otherwise tasted yummy.
