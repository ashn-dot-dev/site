## Ingredients

+ 1 large hamburger patty
+ thinly sliced potato
+ thinly sliced carrot
+ 3 tablespoons of canned corn
+ some minced onion

## Instructions

1. On a square of aluminum foil, place the hamburger patty, potato, carrot,
   corn, and onion.
2. Fold the foil over the mixture and seal.
3. Place on a baking sheet and bake for about 1 hour at 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

## Notes

Prefer lean (85% or 90%) beef when baking hamburger patties in the oven.
Hamburger patties tend to be sold with an 80/20 lean meat/fat mixture in the
grocery store, as that level of fat content will typically produce the best
burger when prepared on a grill. However, when baking hamburger patties in the
oven, excess fat from the beef may pool in the bottom of the baking sheet,
leading to a less enjoyable hobo pack. We want enough fat to hold the burgers
together, but not so much fat that they end up soaked, and 90% lean beef seems
to be the fatty sweet spot. If using fattier beef, you have a couple of options
to remedy the fat pooling: (1) use more veggies as they will absorb additional
fat, or (2) poke holes in the bottom of the foil with a knife to let the fat
drain from the hobo packs into the pan, and then pour this fat out halfway
through baking.

## Variations

### Vegetarian Portobello-Patty Hobo Packs

Substitute the hamburger patty with a large portobello mushroom coated in
warmed butter or olive oil. Sprinkle a bit of Italian seasoning, salt, and
pepper on top of the portobello mushroom before adding the rest of the
vegetables. The portobello mushroom will shrink in size at it bakes, so you may
want to compensate by adding additional potato and carrot slices. Top the
veggie mixture with some fresh rosemary leaves and more Italian seasoning
before sealing in aluminum foil. Bake for 35-40 minutes instead of 1 hour as
the portobello patty will cook significantly faster than a beef patty. As the
mushroom bakes it will release a lot of moisture, so you may want to poke holes
in the bottom of the foil to let the water drain from the hobo pack in a
similar fashion to the fatty patties from the notes above.
