## Ingredients

+ 1 large hamburger patty
+ thinly sliced potato
+ thinly sliced carrot
+ 3 tablespoons of canned corn
+ some minced onion

## Instructions

1. On a square of aluminum foil, place the hamburger patty, potato, carrot,
   corn, and onion.
2. Fold the foil over the mixture and seal.
3. Place on a baking sheet and bake for about 1 hour at 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

## Notes

Prefer lean (85% or 90%) beef when baking hamburger patties in the oven.
Hamburger patties tend to be sold with an 80/20 lean meat/fat mixture in the
grocery store, as that level of fat content will typically produce the best
burger when prepared on a grill. However, when baking hamburger patties in the
oven, excess fat from the beef may pool in the bottom of the baking sheet,
leading to a less enjoyable hobo pack. We want enough fat to hold the burgers
together, but not so much fat that they end up soaked, and 90% lean beef seems
to be the fatty sweet spot. If using fattier beef, you have a couple of options
to remedy the fat pooling: (1) use more veggies as they will absorb additional
fat, or (2) poke holes in the bottom of the foil with a knife to let the fat
drain from the hobo packs into the pan, and then pour this fat out halfway
through baking.
