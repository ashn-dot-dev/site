  [2020-07-04] PICO-8 Disco Descent (1-1)
  </h3>
  <p>
  My partner and I did a produce-a-song-in-one-day challenge.
  I am still learning how to read sheet music and use the PICO-8 tracker, so it
  took me an embarrassingly long time to get this piece together.
  I had to cut out a pretty large chunk of the track's middle section due to
  time constraints, and I think that the effects and harmonies could be a lot
  better, but all in all things didn't turn out too badly.
