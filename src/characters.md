## Ashley

Ashley is a college-aged student in her third or fourth year of university
studying computer science. She has a strong desire to learn from first
principles and build things from scratch, which occasionally prevents her from
reaching out for help and building upon the foundation of others. Ashley is
written as the student in Socratic dialogues.
