## Ashley

Ashley is a college-aged student in her third or fourth year of university
studying computer science. She has a strong desire to learn from first
principles and build things from scratch, which occasionally prevents her from
reaching out for help and building upon the foundation of others. Ashley is
written as the student in Socratic dialogues.

**WARNING**: The Asheley character portrait below was generated with the AI
pixel-art generator at
[perchance.org](https://perchance.org/ai-pixel-art-generator). I am working to
replace this AI slop with character art from a professional artist as soon as
possible.

Ashley's character design is based off of this pixel art avatar in the style of
Crypt of the Necrodancer that I made forever ago in
[Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/).

Hey there! This is what my dialogue box will look like. My character portraits
will be in this small square on the left side of each dialogue box.
