## Ashley

Ashley is a college-aged student in her third or fourth year of university
studying computer science. She has a strong desire to learn from first
principles and build things from scratch, which occasionally prevents her from
reaching out for help and building upon the foundation of others. Ashley is
written as the student in Socratic dialogues.

**WARNING**: Ashley's current character art was generated using AI pixel-art
generator at [perchance.org](https://perchance.org/ai-pixel-art-generator). I
am working to replace this AI slop with character art from a professional
artist as soon as possible.

Hey there! This is what my dialogue box will look like. My character portraits
will be in this small square on the left side of each dialogue box.
