Justice for George Floyd Philadelphia Protest
=============================================

Today I had the privilege to march with thousands of my fellow Philadelphians in
protest of police brutality and the institutions that continue to enable the
oppression of black Americans nationwide.
I hope that the following images will help convey the overwhelming sense of
strength and unity that this movement and this city share in the fight to better
our country and the lives of its citizens.

George Floyd's life mattered

Breonna Taylor's life mattered

✊ BLACK LIVES MATTER ✊
