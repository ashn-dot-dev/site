<h1>Hello World</h1>

<!--MAIN CONTENT-->
Happy new year!
<br><br>

Today marks the first day of the year 2020<a href="#ft1">[1]</a>, as well as
the day I unveil of this little corner of the internet I am calling my blog.
I've been wanting to set up a blog for a while now, but for the longest time I
have avoided setting up any sort of web presence:
<ol>
  <li>
    Because I didn't feel as if I had the time to dedicate to an additional side
    project on top of my current set of side projects, work life, and personal
    life.
  </li>
  <li>
    I am absolutely horrendous at web development.
  </li>
</ol>

In spite of this reasoning I finally decided to bite the bullet over this past
holiday season and put together a small
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~ashn/site">repo</a>
containing a hacked together static site generation script in Bash.
It's certainly not the most elegant piece of software I've ever written, but it
does the job for this "hello world" blog post.
Currently the site requires only standard POSIX tools + Bash to build, does not
need client-side JavaScript enabled, and
<a href="https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc">cloc</a>s in at less than 100 lines
of code (Bash + CSS + template HTML), which makes my happy as a minimalist
software enthusiast.
<br><br>

I don't have much else to say for now, but hopefully if you check back in over
the next couple of months I will have an interesting assortment of posts on
software development worth a read.
<br><br>

Stay hydrated.
