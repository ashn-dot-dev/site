Hello World
===========

Happy new year!

Today marks the first day of the year 2020[\[1\]](#ft1), as well as the day I
unveil of this little corner of the internet I am calling my blog.
I have been wanting to create my own site/blog for a while, but did not get
around to setting up any sort of web presence until now because:

00. I didn't feel as if I had the time to dedicate to an additional side project
    on top of my current set of side projects, work life, and personal life.
00. I am absolutely horrendous at web development and am not particularly fond
    of the web as a platform.

In spite of the above I  bit the bullet this past holiday season and put
together a small [repo](https://git.sr.ht/~ashn/site) containing a hacked
together static site generation script in Bash.
It's certainly not the most elegant piece of software I've ever written, but it
does the job for this "hello world" blog post.
Currently this site builds using standard POSIX tools + Bash + Pandoc, does not
require JavaScript or WebAssembly to be enabled, and
[cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc)s in at less than 100 lines of code
(Bash + CSS + template HTML).
Overall I am pretty happy with this first pass of the site!

I don't have much else to say for now, but hopefully if you check back in over
the next couple of months I will have an interesting assortment of posts on
software development worth a read.

Stay hydrated.
