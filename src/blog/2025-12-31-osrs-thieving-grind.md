Stealing Valuables From 1000 Varlamore Houses In Old School RuneScape
=====================================================================

## Background

I want to talk about an Old School RuneScape grind that took up the latter half
of my 2025. From the end of July to the beginning of December, I spent nearly
all of my time in Old School RuneScape grinding thieving in Civitas illa Fortis
by pickpocketing wealthy citizens and burgling homes, collectively known as the
[stealing valuables](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Stealing_valuables)
activity on the Old School RuneScape wiki.

2025 was a hectic year for our family: my partner and I went through an
emergency medical incident with our cat on the same day I started a new job,
we bought and moved into a house, got married, had to handle the passing of my
partner's mother, had to handle my partner getting laid off, and I had multiple
high-visibility projects that I was leading at work. And this is all in
addition to the normal trials and tribulations that come with maintaining a
home, maintaining a relationship, maintaining a community, and working on my
other side projects. There were a lot of events going on, a lot of emotions to
work through, and surprisingly little time in which to do it all.

Old School RuneScape is my comfort game of choice, and with everything that had
already happened by July of this year, I was looking for some repetitive
gameplay that I could use as a distraction. I have a mid-game [ultimate
ironman](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ironman_Mode#Ultimate), so stealing
valuables seemed like a perfect activity during this time period: looting
houses had decent thieving xp rates of ~100k xp/hr, pickpocketing keys and
looting houses required very few inventory slots, the activity gave me some
passive gp in the background, and leveling my thieving would set me up for a
future farming grind requiring me to pickpocket thousands of seeds from master
farmers. Most importantly though, both the pickpocketing and burgling portions
of the activity can be done in small time increments. Regardless of whether I
had 5 minutes on the toilet in the morning, 45 minutes on the bus to and from
work, or 4 hours vegging out on a weekend with YouTube on the second monitor,
the activity fit my schedule.

## Grind Summary

I started this grind on 2025-07-29 and ended it on 2025-12-02 with
approximately 76 hours of playtime over 44 days in which I logged on at least
once, gaining a total of 5,904,264 thieving experience from level 75 up to
level 93, 8,231,135 gp (6,295,410 of that from turning in 114,462
[valuables](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Valuables) stolen from houses),
broke down 363 [blessed bone
statuettes](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Blessed_bone_statuette) into
45,375 [blessed bone
shards](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Blessed_bone_shards) which I
subsequently turned into 226.9k prayer xp at the [libation
bowl](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Libation_bowl). All of these metrics
were tracked in a spreadsheet that I updated daily during the grind. A CSV
export of that spreadsheet can be found
[here](/blog/2025-12-31-osrs-thieving-grind/data.csv) for those who are
interested.

## Miscellaneous Notes

I was relatively sloppy with my gameplay, and by my vibe-based estimate I
probably got kicked out of 1 in 25 houses, losing some gp and valuables. So the
amount of gp and valuables one could get from this grind would be higher for
another individual with perfect locked-in gameplay.

Pickpocketing wealthy citizens gives you a **ton** of easy clues. In fact, I
think it might be the easiest way to get easy clues that I have found for an
ultimate ironman. Although not the main goal of this grind, I ended up opening
122 easy caskets while pickpocketing my way up to 1000 house keys, which
allowed me to complete my set of [black gold trimmed wizard
robes](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Black_gold-trimmed_wizard_robes) and
netted me a [ham joint](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ham_joint).

The [House Thieving Varlamore
plugin](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/varlamore-house-thieving) is a
must-have for this activity. The plugin will give you notifications when
wealthy citizens can be pickpocketed without failing, when a home owner is
almost home, when a new bonus chest appears, and will show you an arrow where
the next house to burgle is. With this plugin on, it is actually pretty easy to
AFK this activity, making it prime second-monitor content.

I got Rocky at 83 thieving! Rocky is my first pet, and I was super pumped to
get him so early! On the day that I got the pet, I was actually talking to a
player with 99 thieving who was over 2,500 keys into a grind to get the pet. So
better luck next time, dude. I hope you have gotten your own Rocky since we
talked.

## Conclusions

Okay so how did the grind go? Really well, actually! Originally this grind (and
this blog post) was going to be called "75 to 99 Thieving in Old School
RuneScape by Stealing Valuables" because I thought I would just grind from my
level at the start of this grind, 75 thieving, straight to 99 thieving.
However, partway through this grind I realized I was actually getting a little
bit bored, so I ended up changing my end goal from "get 99 thieving" to "burgle
1000 houses".

I did in fact complete that goal of burgling those 1000 houses, and as a result
my character is pretty stacked in thieving levels. Although thieving is no
longer my highest skill at the time I am writing this blog post, thieving is by
far my highest non-combat skill and probably will be for a while. This was a
great way to train on an ultimate ironman, a great way to get in some afk
training in during a hectic year, and is a grind that I am quite satisfied
with.
