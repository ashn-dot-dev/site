Oh and I guess I am like a new character on this website or something? I get
these neat dialogue boxes which can also contain other text effects such as
that {{Wave}}wavy text{{/Wave}} from earlier. That is pretty neat, although I
would appreciate if you could find a human artist to make me some proper
character portraits instead of this placeholder image.

For example, this `Image` tag has a body that contains the alt text for the
displayed image.

Mya, an elderly black lab, stares out of left frame while holding a green
tennis ball in her mouth. Mya is sitting outside in a grassy field next to a
fence while wearing her pink activity harness, likely at the tail end of a
fulfilling walk & ball session.
