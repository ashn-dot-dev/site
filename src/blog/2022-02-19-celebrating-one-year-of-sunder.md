Celebrating One Year of Sunder
==============================

One year ago today I began working on the project that would eventually become
[Sunder](https://github.com/ash-nolan/sunder), a C-like systems programming
language and compiler for x86-64 Linux. These past twelve months have been an
incredible experience, and I am pleased to say that Sunder has far exceeded my
expectations for where I thought the project would be after a year of
development. Although I plan to continue working on Sunder in my spare time, I
have more-or-less accomplished all of the goals that I originally envisioned
for the project, and I am satisfied with where the language and compiler stand
today. Happy first birthday Sunder!
