Creating a C Documentation Generator - Part 3
=============================================

Welcome to part 3 of a series in which we design and implement `cdoc` - a
source-code documentation tool for the C programming language.
In [part 2](/blog/2020-02-22-creating-cdoc-part-2.html) defined the rough shape
of our documentation language and revamped our example file.
In this post we will write the logic that will parse a C source file and output
HTML based on the documentation in that file.
