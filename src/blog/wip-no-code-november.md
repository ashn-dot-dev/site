No Code November
================

Goal is go the entire month of November 2021 without writing code outside of a
work setting in an attempt to catch up on life TODOs, diversify my hobbies, take
care of my body a bit better (cooking healthy meals, stretching, working out,
giving my wrists and hands a break), and maybe read a book or two.

The term "no code" includes library work (autil, braille-pattern-graphics,
etc.), the Sunder language/compiler, for-fun one-off mini projects like
braille-apple, and any other side project ideas that I may think of over the
course of the month.

I want to explicitly specify that work on my personal website does *NOT* count
as "code" as long as the website changes are cosmetic (like updating CSS or page
structure), accessibility improvements (like adding alt text to media elements),
or writing for blog posts (as long as those blog posts are not themselves about
code that I had to write for the post). Additionally, I want to be clear that
"no code" does not mean "no project planning"; after this month I will likely
resume some of my work on Sunder and I want to have the freedom to update
issues, jot down ideas, and scope out future work as needed.

At the end of the month I want to turn this WIP post into a full blog post
detailing what I did this November, how writing "no code" made me feel, and if
there are any lessons I want to draw from the experience moving forward.
