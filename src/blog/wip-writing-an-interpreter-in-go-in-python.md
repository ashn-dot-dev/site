Writing an Interpreter in Go in Python
======================================

Over the past few of months I have had the pleasure of working through Thorsten
Ball's [*Writing an Interpreter in Go*](https://interpreterbook.com/) (version
1.7) in my free time. I purchased both a physical and digital copy of the text
in December of 2020, read through the book once without writing a line code, and
then read through the book again while following along with my own interpreter
implementation[^1] in Python 3, finishing the last chapter in mid-February.

Working through *Writing an Interpreter in Go* has been an absolute joy. I can
confidently say that this book is one of the best introductory texts on
programming language implementation that I have ever come across.  In my
personal experience I have found that most introductory texts tend to
overindulge on theory and leave the reader without great deal of practical
knowledge on *how* to write an interpreter or compiler. Ball's book,
contrarily, is all about practical knowledge. The introduction section crams
the ceremonial "what is a compiler" spiel as well as a brief overview of the
book's toy language into just a little over six pages, and that is about the
only section of the book that *won't* have your writing hands on code.
