Creating a C Documentation Generator - Part 2
=============================================

Welcome to part 2 of a series in which we design and implement `cdoc` - a
source-code documentation tool for the C programming language.
In [part 1(TODO-link)](TODO) we created the skeleton for our program and stubbed
out the documentation code with a pseudo-`cat` implementation.
In this post we will define the rules for a minimal documentation language and
implement the data structures and algorithms needed to transpile that language
into HTML.

## A Minimal Documentation Language
Over the past couple of years using Doxygen I have settled into a particular
style of documentation that I would like to replicate in `cdoc`.

Take for example an idiomatic swap function:

```c
void swap(void* p1, void* p2, size_t size);
```

I would write a Doxygen doc-comment for this as:

```c
//! Exchange two objects of equal size.
//! @param p1
//!     Pointer to the first object.
//! @param p2
//!     Pointer to the second object.
//! @param size
//!     The sizeof both objects.
//! @note
//!     Objects @p1 and @p2 may point to overlapping memory.
void swap(void* p1, void* p2, size_t size);
```

using `//!` [comment blocks](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html)
and Javadoc style [commands](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html).
Also note that I prefer to indent the text after a command.
This documentation style would work well for `cdoc` because takes minimal effort
to parse correctly and uses the Javadoc syntax that many developers already have
a familiarity with.

One thing I do want to change is the very first brief section of a doc-comment.
Documentation generators such as Doxygen and Javadoc parse the source language
in addition to doc-comments; Doxygen knows that `swap` is a function because it
has a fairly sophisticated C (really C++) parser providing that information.
We **really** do not want to go down the rabbit hole of implementing a C parser,
so we will require the user tell us what C construct the doc-comment refers to:

```c
//! @function swap
//!     Exchange two objects of equal size.
//! @param p1
//!     Pointer to the first object.
//! @param p2
//!     Pointer to the second object.
//! @param size
//!     The sizeof both objects.
//! @note
//!     Objects @p1 and @p2 may point to overlapping memory.
void swap(void* p1, void* p2, size_t size);
```

## Informal Grammar
Our documentation language is... well... a language, and every language has a
grammar - the set of rules describing what is and is not a valid input accepted
by the language.
Real computer scientistsâ„¢ describe these rules using a
[formal grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar),
perhaps in notation such as
[Bacus-Naur form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form).

If we were producing a formal language specification or writing a non-trivial
parser then coming up with rigorous grammar would certainly be necessary.
But we are in more of an exploratory "hack it together and see what works"
phase, so I would rather describe our language in simple English and build our
parsing code based on that.

TODO: Figure out good way to describe in plain English.

+ `doc`
+ `section`
+ `line`

Each line of a `doc` / `section` must begin with `//!`.

A `section`'s first line must take the form `//! @TAG` or the
form `//! @TAG NAME`, i.e. `NAME` is optional.

A `section`'s remaining lines are treated as HTML.

And for good measure we will say that whitespace is lenient: the lines of a
doc comment may have leading or trailing horizontal whitespace and amount
of horizontal whitespace is treated as one whitespace character.

## Defining Data Structures
Our informal grammar definition was described in terms of three "things":
`line`, `section`, and `doc`.
Let's translate each of these "things" into C data structures within our `cdoc`
program.

### Line
A `line` of text is a sequence of characters ending with a newline character.
If we were to replace each newline character with a `NUL` character then lines
could be stored as a `NUL` terminated string, i.e. `char*` or `char const*`.

### Section
```c
struct section
{
    char const* tag_start;
    int tag_len;

    char const* name_start;
    int name_len;

    char const** body_lines;
    size_t body_lines_count;

}
```

### Doc
```c
struct doc
{
    struct section* sections;
    size_t sections_count;
};
```
