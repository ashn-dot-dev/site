Programming Language Name Generator
===================================

Perl, Ruby, Lua, Dart, Java, Haxe, Nim, Odin, Rust, and Zig. These languages
all have catchy names. And as we all know, having a catchy name is the most
important feature of any programming language. But coming up with a name that
is both catchy and original can be difficult, so today I am proudly introducing
my breakthrough contribution to the PL community: `plname.py` - a programming
language name generator.

Use `plname.py` as a standalone script:

```sh
$ ./plname.py 10
Tud
Bdqi
Rsvu
Nzi
Fam
Pog
Njo
Lzga
Ygi
Gil
```

or as a module:

```txt
$ python3 -q
>>> from plname import *
>>> for i in range(6):
...     print(f"Language name idea #{i}:", plname())
...
Language name idea #0: Uxbl
Language name idea #1: Vuar
Language name idea #2: Yfbe
Language name idea #3: Sat
Language name idea #4: Rvmu
Language name idea #5: Gonr
```

With this *revolutionary* technology you too can generate your own vaguely
western sounding three-to-four letter name that is guaranteed to catapult your
language to the top of the GitHub trending page!

This is a tongue-in-cheek joke. No disrespect is intended towards any of the
aforementioned languages, their authors, or members of their respective
communities. 😛
