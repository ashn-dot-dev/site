75 to 99 Thieving in Old School RuneScape by Stealing Valuables
===============================================================

## Pre-Grind Notes

+ Filled all easy clue STASH units so I did not have to build and/or item hunt during the grind.
+ Wanted to get to 100 easy clue completions before the grind started for the clue box. I got to 85, but I did not really want to grind out another 15 on gourmet implings before starting the grind, and just doing 2 clues at a time during the thieving portion seemed like it would be fine.
    + I am going to save all my clue reward chests for the end of the grind because there is a 1/50 chance for a master clue, and I might be able to juggle master clues depending on how many easy caskets I get.
+ Got my arrow count down to exactly 20000 for the aesthetics.
+ Alched my amulet of power, and killed lizardmen for a Xeric's talisman (inert). The amulet of power doesn't go with the rogue's outfit and I am not going to be doing any combat for 125+ hours so I didn't need it. I am hoping to get a trimmed amulet of power from the easy clues as well, so maybe I'll get lucky.
+ Got a black satchel for my off-hand item to go with the black and tan aesthetic.
+ Filled up my rune pouch to 16k fire runes, 16k water runes, and 6k law runes exactly so that I can see how many runes I used going for easy clues.
+ Dropped off all of my gold at the coffer in Ferox Enclave so that I can see exactly how much gold this grind gave me.
    + the 1 gp placeholder I had in my inventory screenshots was dropped before beginning the grind.
+ Got to exactly 1676 total level so that my 99 thieving would give me 1700 total level.
+ Killed red dragons in the Forthos dungeon to get exactly 800,000 prayer xp, both for the clean xp total, and to give me a better idea of just how much prayer xp I get from blessed bone shards once this grind is over.
+ Was going to go for the medium desert diary to get the red heart necklace, but the xp reward from Enakhra's Lament would have given me a crafting level and put me over 1700 total level at the end of the grind.
+ Was going to get nature runes for high alching, but the xp from high alching would have almost certainly given me a magic level by the time this grind was over, so opted to use free low alchs plus the general store for this grind.

## Start of Grind Info and Rules

+ Prepped in the evening of 2025-07-28 at ~9:00 PM.
+ Starting the grind in the morning of 2025-07-29 on the way to work.
+ Starting the grind with 1,210,715 thieving xp - just over the level 75 mark.
+ Grind seems like it will be 125+ hours.
+ Started with ~1232 hours of playtime.
+ I will us xp lamps on herblore, but will not be doing any other random events that give items, gp, or xp (e.g. bob the cat fishing random).
+ I will not be collecting from tears of guthix during this grind.
+ I will allow myself to do holiday and seasonal events if I have the change, but we'll see if I actually need to before finishing this grind.
+ Probably going to go for 1000 hourse keys first and see how many clues, gp, and xp that gets me. I know I'll need to do more, but don't know if it will be like 2000 total keys, or 3000 total keys, or even more.

## Mid-Grind Notes

+ Set most NPC left click options to `Walk here` for citizens, tourists, the street urchins, etc. Basically, I wanted to prevent misclicks if I moused over the wrong NPC when going for thieving the wealthy citizens in the market.
    + For some reason, menu entry swapper on mobile doesn't work as well as in RuneLite. It seems like the options of NPC were somehow linked, like if I set one NPC to `Walk here` on tap, then all NPCs would get that, including the wealthy citizens. Not sure if that is a bug or feature.
+ Swapped left click on easy reward caskets to `Use` so I could stack them.
+ I opened 15 easy caskets day 1 of the grind to get up to 100 for the scroll case. No master clue thankfully.
    + I completed my black wizard robes (g) set and I got a ham joint! Such a good 15 clues. Also a full black wizard (g) set in 100 caskets is great RNG.
+ I think a goal of ~100k xp/day amortized, which equates to ~1hr of playtime a day.
+ Created a spreadsheet to track metrics throughout the grind. Each entry will correspond to the EOD stats.
+ I got Rocky at 83 thieving with ~2,850,000 xp! I grabbed a redberry from Varok and turned him into Red!

## End-Grind Notes
+ On 2025-12-02 I looted house key 1000/1000, ending at theiving level 73.
    + Average thieving xp/hr was ~102k towards the end of the house looting grind.
    + Traded in 114,462 valuables for 6,295,410 coins, bumping my gp from 1,935,725 to 8,231,135.
+ Trained a little bit of fletching and runecrafting as well as a bunch of crafting that day, but otherwise I think I am calling the grind there. I think just looting 1000 keys is easier than going all the way to 99, and I want to do some other contnet.
