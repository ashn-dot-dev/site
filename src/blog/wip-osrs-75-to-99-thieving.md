75 to 99 Thieving in Old School RuneScape by Stealing Valuables
===============================================================

## Pre-Grind Work

+ Filled all easy clue STASH units so I did not have to build and/or item hunt during the grind.
+ Wanted to get to 100 easy clue completions before the grind started for the clue box. I got to 85, but I did not really want to grind out another 15 on gourmet implings before starting the grind, and just doing 2 clues at a time during the thieving portion seemed like it would be fine.
    + I am going to save all my clue reward chests for the end of the grind because there is a 1/50 chance for a master clue, and I might be able to juggle master clues depending on how many easy caskets I get.
+ Got my arrow count down to exactly 20000 for the aesthetics.
+ Alched my amulet of power, and killed lizardmen for a Xeric's talisman (inert). The amulet of power doesn't go with the rogue's outfit and I am not going to be doing any combat for 125+ hours so I didn't need it. I am hoping to get a trimmed amulet of power from the easy clues as well, so maybe I'll get lucky.
+ Got a black satchel for my off-hand item to go with the black and tan aesthetic.
+ Filled up my rune pouch to 16k fire runes, 16k water runes, and 6k law runes exactly so that I can see how many runes I used going for easy clues.
+ Dropped off all of my gold at the coffer in Ferox Enclave so that I can see exactly how much gold this grind gave me.
    + the 1 gp placeholder I had in my inventory screenshots was dropped before beginning the grind.
+ Got to exactly 1676 total level so that my 99 thieving would give me 1700 total level.
+ Killed red dragons in the Forthos dungeon to get exactly 800,000 prayer xp, both for the clean xp total, and to give me a better idea of just how much prayer xp I get from blessed bone shards once this grind is over.
+ Was going to go for the medium desert diary to get the red heart necklace, but the xp reward from Enakhra's Lament would have given me a crafting level and put me over 1700 total level at the end of the grind.
+ Was going to get nature runes for high alching, but the xp from high alching would have almost certainly given me a magic level by the time this grind was over, so opted to use free low alchs plus the general store for this grind.

## Start of Grind Info and Rules

Prepped in the evening of 2025-07-28 at ~9:00 PM.
Starting the grind in the morning of 2025-07-29 on the way to work.
Starting the grind with 1,210,715 thieving xp - just over the level 75 mark.
Grind seems like it will be 125+ hours.
Started with ~1232 hours of playtime.
I will us XP lamps on herblore, but will not be doing any other random events that give items, gp, or xp (e.g. bob the cat fishing random).
I will not be collecting from tears of guthix during this grind.
I will allow myself to do holiday and seasonal events if I have the change, but we'll see if I actuall need to before finishing this grind.
Probably going to go for 1000 hourse keys first and see how many clues, gp, and xp that gets me. I know I'll need to do more, but don't know if it will be like 2000 total keys, or 3000 total keys, or even more.
